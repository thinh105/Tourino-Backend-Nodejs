I would thoroughly recommend this trip to those wanting a taste of Vietnam."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The itinerary was perfect for a 10 day tour—a good overview of the country at a good pace. We had enough free time if we wanted it, but we really enjoyed doing things with our group!  Our guide, Charlie, typically does foodie tours, so we had excellent meals, especially when we followed his recommendations. \n\nWe had a few minor disappointments.  A couple of the restaurants had slow and erratic service (meals coming out at different times so some people had to wait while others ate.) This may be an expectation that is based on what we get at home, so I don’t want to blame the tour company for that. A few times we were advised that we could use credit cards when, in fact, the business only took cash. \n\nApart from the minor things mentioned, it was a really fantastic vacation!  Charlie was quite entertaining, and it was great to experience Vietnam with him.  I recommend doing as many of the optional activities as possible.  The tour by motorcycle was so much fun—definitely a highlight.  Bicycling through the city streets and countryside was also amazing, especially when going through rice paddies. Cyclo tours, tuk tuk tours, boating in the Mekong delta, and celebrating New Year’s in Hoi An are all wonderful memories.  This was our first organized tour after many overseas trips on our own, so we were not sure if we’d like it.  After experiencing this tour, I highly recommended it!"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Great guide Lan was fun informative & helpful - I cant remember his surname\nNorth to South was great but will go back to Hao Long bay & sail a few days longer- will return to Vietnam & intrepid"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"I had a wonderful time on the tour.

Other than that, I really loved the trip and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Great tour: highlights HalongBay, train to Hue, Hoi An and the Mekong Delta day.  Hotels all very well appointed:  Last hotel in HCMC unfortunately did not have a bar or restaurant (open evenings) onsite for guests to gather.

My guide Nhung was really informative and she helped me find a driver when I wanted to book a personal day trip to Bana Hills on our day off. My only complaint was that we didn't get to spend enough time at Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh while on the tour. I would advise arriving a day early before the start of the tour and extending your stay at the end by a day or 2, just to give yourself time to really experience these cities"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Tuyen our tour guide was awesome, his help and knowledge beat all my expectations of this trip.

He was enthusiastic and good natured and made the whole trip very memorable. I could not fault him.

I would do this tour again if I could and will definitely book my next tour with Intro. The guide I had, Brad, had a real connection with the culture and passion for Vietnam, which made the tour that extra bit special.

Im sure there is more to Vietnam than the 9 days, but if there is a person who could do more in that time, then they must be an insomniac. The only regret, not going for the 12 days! \n\nFirstly, and most importantly, I want to say a huge thank you to Sam for making this trip the way it did. Sam went above and beyond any expectation I could have had in leading the tour. As we jokingly recalled later in the trip, my negligence had left him stray at the airport for 2 hours even before the journey began! Beneath it shows the caring side of a person willing to give up so much of their time just to make sure everything was fine. It can't have been easy to manage a group of 20+. When I left the trip, there had not been a single issue between any of us and though some things may have been a little different, ultimately, I have realised that making new friends and exploring a country well are my objectives well fulfilled here. So much of this is down to the way it was all managed. \n\nSome secondary notes to that, as a vegetarian I was a little anxious on meals out here. However I felt well catered for throughnout the trip and although a couple of days the food is repeated that's no different to how it may be in London for me. The trip does have a lot of travelling inbetween it, so if you want to drink and my word did we (this is optional) then be prepared to be have a rough journey or two. Again completely self inflicted. Vietnamese people are lovely and seem as keen on travellers having a great time and again this only tops off what was a superb holiday. \n\nIve been lucky enough to do a few of these tours and whilst they have been enjoyable, this and a previous trip to NZ were incredible. Their endeavour into making this trip not only honest in showing the country but to make sure they squeeze every bit of fun they can from the journey is why I wanted to say more than just \"thank you\". \n\nThank you,"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This tour was amazing from start to finish.

In addition, we made a little modification of the itinerary to include a day-trip to Hue instead of a foodie tour in Hoi An and it appeared to be the best day of the tour - Hue is a beautiful place and the guide (Viet) with her modest but strong personality made it exceptionally pleasant. Nevertheless, our co-travellers in the group (who did not join us for a Hue trip) said they enjoyed the foodie tour as well.\nRegarding the organization of the tour, everything worked well, in spite of the fact that the tour was organized as a sequence of individual services with different guides in different cities. Personally, I like that concept since it makes the tour more interesting - each guide added her/his personal touch to the kaleidoscope of overall experience (not to mention that it is much cheaper that way than the classic tour with one guide). \nAll in all, I would recommend Hoi An Express for travelling in South East Asia and we have already started to think about travelling to Mianmar with them."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"An excellent tour with good guides and trips.

The Lavender Cruise company hurried us all the time and we even arrived back at the port 1 hour earlier than scheduled and had to wait the hour for the transfer back to Hanoi.  This Cruise was not by Hoi Ann but was with a different provider however, its part of Hoi Ann's tour so it brings down the tour rating."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"My cousin and I went on this tour and were so happy with the whole tour itinerary we couldn’t fault it hotels were great value the tour guides were informative I’d highly recommend this tour to everyone"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Very helpful and accomodatung"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"The tour was good and most of the arrangements were done quite well. However, we had paid extra to upgrade the accommodation from 3 star to 4 star and still in couple of places we were given 3 star accommodations. Despite complaints, they didn’t care. My strong recommendation is that you should either accept the included 3 star accommodations or get in writing from them about 4 star if you are paying extra."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"We actually had four guides but this review only let me select one of them.  In Ho Chi Minh we had Bau who was 5/5.  His knowledge was interesting and his manner was friendly and helpful.  We had Hung in Da Nang and Hoi An who was again excellent.  He really looked after our group and his positive personality was appreciated.  His knowledge was informative and he went to extra mile to help us.  Then we had Young in for one day in Hanoi.  He was very friendly but I found him difficult to understand.  Lastly on the Halong Bay tour we had Peter and he was friendly and his knowledge of the area was excellent, especially in the caves we visited. \nOverall I was very satisfied with the Tour and found the organisation to be excellent.  I think more could have been done in Ho Chi Minh - a simple 1 hour city tour would have been good.  I will certainly be recommending Tour Radar and Hoi An express to others.  Thank you.

I was greeted by Anna from Intro Travel who is so friendly, chatty and helpful! This tour has had such a great balance of country side, travelling between and city’s.

I couldn’t say a bad thing about this tour as I enjoyed every minute of it with a fun group of people! Intro organised so many fun activities to fill our days with and had excellent suggestions for places to go and places to see in our free time! The suggestion to take a lantern making class in Hoi An was a great tip and now I have an amazing souvenir that will remind me of Vietnam at home!

( anyone can find those tourist places )\nBeware of the train trip, it’s an horrendous experience and takes days to recover from, ie you won’t get any sleep at all !!\nAlso be prepared for extra expenses for the optional activities and the tipping kitty of USD 22 per person, which I believe was used to pay the bus drivers.\nYou could plan the same trip yourself for half the price and stay in better hotels that are closer to everything you want to do."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Ha and Yuth were great guides with knowledge and excellent skills to manage group trips.

From the moment we booked this trip to saying our goodbyes on the last day everything was perfect. Our guide Thanh, a local, was superb.  He had a great sense of humour and presented himself immaculately every day.  He managed our group so well. We were exceptionally lucky as our entire group were lovely.  Everyone respected meet up times, so we didn't waste time waiting for anyone and we all got on really well and we didn't have any moaners (people who love to complain about everything). All the accommodation was comfortable and clean, the overnight train is exactly as described, an experience I wouldn't have missed for the world. The day out on the bikes was brilliant fun, led by experienced riders. We felt safe all the time. Thanh took us to some wonderful restaurants, always going through the menu giving us ideas on what he recommended. If you're looking at whether to do the North to South or South to North trip, I'd suggest South to North.  Ending the trip in Halong Bay on an over nightboat (again the accommodation on here was so comfortable) literally ended the whole trip on a high. It was excellent value for money and Intrepid's ethos of reducing plastic waste by giving us all our own bag to carry around instead of accepting goods we bought in plastic and having water available on all mini buses and in all hotel rooms so we could top up our own reusable cups was a wonderful touch. The whole experience will remain with us forever and we will definitely book another Intrepid adventure in the future."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Apsalutely fantastic trip!

He looked after everyone as well, which is a good sign of someone who cares about travelers in a foreign country. The main areas of improvement for Vietnam on a Shoestring is the accommodation and meals. Considering the cost of the tour, i was hoping for moderately comfortable hostels and at least more than one instance with double sharing. Majority of lodging was dormitory style and in at least half of them, appliances/amenities didn’t work or there was loud construction, bumping street noise, and dirty bathrooms. As a frequent traveler in Southeast Asia, it appears the company makes money on the accommodation front. Included meals also had poor offerings for vegans, and this is something i clarified before booking the trip, being promised that there would be options. More like a few pieces of fruit or bread. The company can do better at accommodating guests with special diets, especially if we’re paying for it. I was disappointed with these two things that forced me to always look after my own meals, have to plan ahead, and a few times book my own room so i can have some good sleep. Itinerary, excursions/activities not included, and guide (Saroeun) - otherwise - were ace. \nSad to think G Adventures overcharges and makes money considering what accommodations we had!"},{"rating":"3.5","review":"Min is a fantastic tour guide.

Our guide was very friendly and accommodating. Everywhere we stopped to eat was good. My only complaints were with the first hotel in Da Nang, which had a lot of insects, and the restaurant bathrooms of some of the places we stopped to eat. It was during the New Year holiday so options for restaurants were a bit limited. Other than that, great trip, beautiful country, friendly people everywhere."},{"rating":"3.0","review":"This tour had a variety of interesting places to visit but a lot of motoring between sites .I suppose as I was alone with the driver and the guide . I had nobody to talk to during the travel . The guide was interesting but his level of English and his pronounciarion made it difficult , even impossible to understand him 60% of the time . That was also the opinion of the Australian couple who joined me on the day trip to My Son . The hotels were all right except the Titan Hotel in Da Nang which iwas not situated in a nice area . Far from the city centre , far from everything : decent restaurants or shops . Just massages parlours and motorbikes garages ..... I think there are enough hotels in Da.Nang to find a more interesting one . The choice of the restaurants were good : the lunch  at the Paradise Caves was good , The 2 restaurants in Hue , for dinner and lunch were excellent .The foodie tour at Hoi An was interesting but slightly disappointing and could have been a bit longer and include a trip to Ms Vy’s Market Place for example . Apart from the first morning in Da Nang the guide and driver were punctual . That day I was supposed to be picked up at 7:30 so I was ready at that time but they did not turn up before 8:20 . I was wondering what was happening as it was the first day . It turned out they picked up the other couple in Hoi An before me  but Hoi An Express forgot to let me know .The guide arrived apologising to Rrive too early !The staff at the agency were friendly but there again ,their level of English was very poor .It is incredible that when they work in the tourism industry they don’t Speak English .."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The whole trip was great and very well organized from picking up at the airport until dropping off at the airport for departure. I was the only one on the tour but on the My Son trip there were two couples joining in. I spent the whole week with the same guide (Ricky) and driver, and I could not have been happier with them. Ricky was very knowledgeable and also very helpful, e.g. helping with hotel check-ins where they did not speak (good) English. The whole trip went very smoothly and according to the itinerary, with guide and driver picking me up every morning on time. In this one week I could visit many amazing places. My favourite ones were the impressive Paradise Cave and the ancient town (car free) of Hoi An. At lunch I was taken to restaurants with local delicious food (included in the tour) and for my free time Ricky pointed out some regions that I should explore (sightseeing and food). Da Nang was probably the least exciting part (but still not boring!), one night there would actually be enough. "},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Hoi An Express is a very professional and reliable tour company.  I would highly recommend them.\nTOUR:  Central Vietnam 6 nights, 7 days\nCorrespondence:  Candy\nDrivers:  Dung and Viet\nGuide:  Nguyen Tran Khanh or \"Key\"\nCandy was excellent in replying to my emails - very timely, and addressed any concerns, questions I had.  She was also very patient with all my questions.\nGuide Key speaks English very well, and is very knowledgeable.  I liked that he would look something up if he was unsure of my question.  He was my guide for the whole tour.\nDung was the driver for my day in Da Nang.  Viet was the driver for the rest of the trip.  Both very courteous, they and Key were always punctual, even arrived a few minutes earlier than stated.\n\nThe hotels were rated 3 stars.  All were clean with hot water.  The cleanest being Hoi An Village Villas in Hoi An, Serene Hotel in Hue, and Titan Hotel in Da Nang.  All offered amenities such as complimentary water bottles, kettle, tea, coffee, fridge, shampoos and soaps and bath gels, toothbrushes, etc.  Basic brands but they were available.  The tubs in all the hotels (except Hoi An Village Villa - no tub) were nice after a long day of walking.  All provided breakfasts - some better than others.  I think Titan and Fansipan in Da Nang had the least tasty breakfasts but good coffee.  For my last night stay in Fansipan, they had a boxed breakfast ready for me for my 4am departure, which was really a nice touch.\n\nThe lunches provided were great, especially in Hue.  More than ample food (6-7 course lunches) and all very very tasty.  The least tasty was at the Nam Long in Hoi An on Day 2.  But to give them credit, they were polite and served well, even though I was the only one in the restaurant.  Beautiful surroundings.  Lunch in Hue was my favourite for both taste and ambience.  Others on the road north were tasty, but more cafeteria like surroundings, but clean.\n\nI travelled solo on this trip, and found I was the only one on the tour.  But I felt safe.  Hoi An Express even gave me a cell phone upon arrival so they can contact me, and i them in case I needed anything.  This was my first guided tour so I don't know if this is common, but it was great to be welcomed like that.  Thank goodness they didn't cancel my tour!!\n\nThe sites visited were also just what I wanted - from walking through caves and up mountains (and down) to seeing historical tombs, war zones, temples, architecture, ruins of palaces  There was enough free time as well for me to wander on my own in each city in the late afternoon/evenings. Even the foodie bike tour was interesting - and more enjoyable if only I wasn't so nervous on the bike and biking through the traffic and people.  I did run into a little boy and I fell off my bike, bruised and scratched.  The little boy was ok.  \n\nThe only suggestions I would make:\n1.  if someone arrives in Da Nang, it would be nice to point them towards a restaurant if the hotel doesn't have a restaurant.  I stayed in Titan the first 2 nights, mid-afternoon not having eaten anything since breakfast, been awake since 4am and travelling, so was very tired.  Hotel staff at that shift didn't speak enough English, and couldn't point me towards any restaurants.  I walked 1 block in each direction and gave up.  The hotel restaurant is open only for breakfast.  Nga on the next shift was able to point me towards a restaurant just 3 -4 blocks away.\n2.  In Hoi An, perhaps the guide can inform the tourists that one can get a pass for $6 to all the houses and temples and bridge in the ancient city.  It may have been in the information given, but I didn't really read any of it.  My bad, but just a nudge from the tour guide for 'after the tour', and recommendations for restaurants, would be a nice touch.\n3.  in Hoi An, the Hoi An Village Villas are a bit out in nowhere.  It's a nice quiet spot away from the city, and might be a 45 minute walk into town.  There is a shuttle bus but it runs only 3x a day.  More service would be nice.  At least a mid-afternoon trek into town around 3 or 4pm instead of waiting until past 7pm.\n\nAll in all a great trip, and i thank Candy, Key, and Dung and Viet immensely for making it so."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"This tour was wonderful, overall. My guide, Thanh, was very knowledgeable of all the locations and all the hotels were top notch, new and clean. There were some hiccups during the tour, but it was quickly resolved and made sure the tour continue smoothly. The only issue I had was that the guide was not fully informed of my tour. He thought my tour included dinner, which was not, so he subsequently booked some dinner reservations. I then had to reimbursed the dinners, which wasn't the issue as I did eat the food, but it would have been better for me to find my own dinner. I was on a tight budget, and the additional costs on food was more than I could afford."}]},{"name":"Vietnam's Essential Sapa","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Loved the Echo Lodge.

The only downside was the communication barrier it seemed like they had rehearse what they were supposed to say but when you ask them questions they couldn't really answer your questions or understand what you are saying. There was a miscommunication of how we were supposed to check out of the hotel but then leave our luggage there. There was a lot of talking but the actual message was not given to us to check out. The other thing was was when we had a flight they dropped us off at the airport 5 hours early which was a total waste of a day. And then when we stayed in Hanoi and had to go to halong Bay the six hours total driving back and forth seems kind of unorganized and owais as well. Might as well have stayed 2 days and how long bay in 2 days in Hanoi. We also had a delayed flight and when we landed a tour guide said that we might have had to miss marble Mountain which would have been the coolest thing to do that day on the itinerary. It was not our fault that the flight was delayed and for the tour to schedule such a late flight when they knew marble Mountain would close at 5:30 p.m. didn't make sense and we were almost about to miss it if we didn't push back our meal. Also a little confused about why we had to pay extra for the Lunar New Year when everything was closed so the activities that we were scheduled to do were shortened or  not able to be done. But overall everybody was really nice and we did a lot of activities."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Cool Guides and cool Hotels! "},{"rating":"4.5","review":"It was an amazing experience.

"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Hi, my friend and I started our 8 day tour of Vietnam on the 11th Nov.  This was after touring Cambodia with Intrepid. The day we arrived in Ho Chi Minh, we expected to be met by a tour guide and driver, as advised in the itinerary. This was not the case. We were met by a driver, with little English, and were brought to our hotel.  By chance we met a representative from Legend Travel Group at the hotel, who was dealing with another group. She told us the time we were to meet the next day, and that was about it. There was no real structure to the tour, in that we were left to our own devices each evening, with no advice of places to go to eat etc.  This was a total change from the Intrepid trip, we had experienced the week before. We were met by different tour guides each day, and had different groups of people each day also. The tour guides were very good, and very knowledgeable of their respective areas, but as noted above, as we were meeting a new guide, and new people each day there was no real structure.  \n\nThe accomodation was very basic. Given the price of the trip, I would have expected better. One hotel was not good, in that the room was tiny, and the walls were covered in dampness.  I would like to thank Tony, in Hoi An for looking after us there, and arranging a change of hotel for our last night. The boat trip on Halong Bay was spectacular.  The boat itself was lovely (bedroom on the boat was probably the best out of all the accomodation in Vietnam).  The food was delicious, and the staff on the boat were so friendly and welcoming. The guided tours themselves were very good, we got to see alot, and I could not fault the tour guides, as they were very pleasant and knowledgeable.  The trip was an experience. :)"}]},{"name":"Vietnam Legend - 9 Days","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Very professionel. Every thing was perfekt as Promist Always freindly and professionel.

From Hanoi you travel with your group unescorted on the train, where you are met by a bus driver then transported to Sapa an amazingly beautiful town in the mountains. Plenty of time to do a bit of shopping and eating delicious food before setting out on the hike. I found my enjoyment was hampered by village people hiking all of the trip with you just to try and sell you some tacky items. They got in the way when you were trying to take pictures or climb up or down areas of track. The walking is of moderate intensity but can be hardwork for the average middle aged person in the humidity of the rainy season Scenery is spectacular and the over night train trips great. Getting back to Hanoi and getting a taxi proved problematic and a lot of time was spent trying to get a legitimate driver to take me where I wanted to go.

It was great the Trutravels booked rooms for longer to store bags and have showers before move to the next place. Our tour guides \"Papsi\" and \"Phong\" were great, Papsi was full of energy and came out with us in the evening which was great. Phong was super knowledgeable about the history of Vietnam and knew the best places to get food. The activities on the tour were awesome, my favorite activity was the cooking class.

She was very professional and always making sure we were all prepared and getting the best experience. She knew everything we needed to know or be aware of and we all felt in really good hands. It was a wonderful mix of activities, city and beaches, nature and culture. Definitely would recommend and loved everything that was included. Really good value for money and plenty of inclusions - loved that I didn’t have to stress about transport once or wasting time, there was always something to do, and it was all well organised. The only thing I would suggest or raise is that as much as it’s good not to have a rigid structure for city exploring, there should have either been more time in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh, or at least more guided and supported suggestions and recommendations. There should always be a list of recommended things to do and see or where to eat or drink so that the guide doesn’t have to repeat themselves or forget to tell us, and for us always to refer to just in case. This would also be helpful for historical background info. \n\nOverall, really well done snd thought through, just should be more detail on itinerary and history/local delicacies/info provided for each place as this wasn’t always given. Solid 4/5 stars from me! :)"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The Vietnam Explore tour has been the 4th Trutravels tour I have done and has definitely been one of my favourites! You get to see a lot of the country during the trip, but it doesn't feel rushed and even when some of the transportation between places was delayed/changed Edna handled it really well, so the distance travelled wans't stressful. \n\nMy personal highlights of the trip was quad-biking in the sand dunes, Ninhvana and Castaways,I loved all of it, everything was so much fun! The fact that we had such a good group and the tour guide meant that the experience was so enjoyable - the fact Trutravels tours are so social is an aspect I really like as I've made great friends who I got to share the experience with the cooking class and war museums, were also really good activities as it taught us more about vietnamese culture and history which is important. \n\nWe got to experience culture as well as partying which I'm really glad for.

Instead, I had fallen in with a lovely bunch of people ( tour guides including of course.)\nMy mum and dad who were quite worried about me traveling on my own were instantly relieved when I sent them a group photo of all Trufam. I further made them feel at ease when I told them how safe and content I feel with three main people: \n\n1. Phi - aka mamabear. Phi has literately been my mother on this trip!lol. Especially when it come to all my unnecessary  skin reactions. I would text Phi that I need to go to the pharmacy and within 5 mins he would be there ready to be my trusty translator. Thank you so much Phi for looking after me on this tour.\n\n2. Adam - aka papabear, Adam made me feel less granny and about the fact that I’m a mega introvert and crave space a lot of time. He explained its our holiday and so ‘you do you’. Adam is extremely good at his job asa well as Phi. Very accommodating, organized and efficient.\n\n3. Lauren - aka my travel buddy. I was very fortunate to be paired with a fellow granny - my age, a teacher, dramatic as me > clearly fate as paired together. Being paired with Lauren has made my trip.

However, the biggest let down was he booked the Urban Adventures Mekong Delta River tour for us. On the day, he said we will have a private tour instead - he became the guide himself (unexpected) and then during lunch, told us to pay $1.5 million dong each to a random lady at the village who spoke no english, for the full tour cost.

However, in this case I have no hesitation. What makes it excellent is the level of organisation that goes on beforehand and during the tour. On a cycling tour much depends on the back-up team of the truck driver (for the bikes) the bus driver (for the riders)  the mechanic who rides behind and most of all the tour guide who leads. I have met many tour guides in my time but none have come close to Dahn. Needless to say he lectures in tourism and has won an award for his tour guiding. It was his ability to deal with everything from tired bikers to chefs and waiters in local restaurants that make him special. But most of all it was his ability to bind a number of strangers into a cohesive group with his personality and sense of humour that made the tour wonderful. The standard of the bikes was very good as was the level of comfort of the hotels and the overall quality of the food. What is best of all is the backroads taken through rural landscapes, villages and small towns where most tourists do not get to see. There have been discussions about the level of fitness to enjoy the tour; the average pace was about 20-22k and if you can keep that up for an hour or two you will be fine. We were told emphatically that we had to bring our own helmets which we did at some inconvenience and loss – we donated them at the end. Others on the tour did not and they were supplied.\n\n"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Great tour well led by our leader Tiet. Disappointing to miss out on the rainforest section advertised.

We saw few westerners after we left Sapa until we got back to Hanoi. There was one other tour group that was following a similar itinerary to us and this group accounted for most of the westerners we saw. I particularly liked the fact that we were exploring a part of Vietnam that is visited by relatively few. It gave us an opportunity to meet local tribespeople who had not been affected by tourism. The tour gave is an opportunity to go into peoples' homes and see how people from different ethnic groups live. This was a real education. \n\nThe opportunity to interact with people from different ethnic groups was one of the highlights of this trip. However, given the number if different ethnic groups it became difficult to distinguish between between them. There was just so much information to take in such a relatively short timeframe. I suggested to our tour leader that it would be helpful to have folder available on the bus that provided some basic information on the different ethnic groups and photos showing their traditional dress, style of housing etc. Having such a folder available would allow tour group members to refresh their memories of what they had seen. \n\nOur tour leader provided background information during our long drives. One of the best \"tutorials\" he gave was on the way in which accents are used in the Vietnamese language. I have been to Vietnam twice before but this was the first time that I became aware of the way accents affect the pronunciation of words in Vietnamese. It would be really helpful to provide a sheet with this information at the start of the tour (and at the start of other tours in Vietnam, for that matter.\n\nThe hikes around Sapa were an important feature of the trip but the information on these hikes did not convey the level of difficulty accurately. I am an experienced bushwalker and I found the hikes difficult, mainly because of the tracks being so steep, muddy and eroded. The hike later in the trip was much easier and was a terrific activity for those who joined in. I am glad I went on the Sapa hikes and I experienced a real sense of achievement by the time I reached the end but I would have brought different footwear had I been aware of the poor condition of the track on the uphill and downhill stretches. I would also have brought walking poles which is what I normally use when I bushels back home.\n\nFinally, the scenery on this trip is absolutely breathtaking. I knew the the area was mountainous but I wasn't expecting the views to be so spectacular."},{"rating":"4.3","review":"Overall the tour was absolutely incredible.

Our guide, though very knowledgeable, made us feel as though he was rushing the entire day. He would take us to a site, talk about it for  minutes and tell us we had 5 minutes to take pictures and wander around and then off to the next point.  This barely gave time to go to the washroom (and with 2 small kids, this was a must).  Our group had 8 people, our family was 4 of those 8.  I was usually in the middle of the pack with the children and the people in the back, enjoying opportunities for photographs were usually at least 800 meters behind the guide.  There were times when he was walking so far ahead we couldn't even see him.  Then, when we went on the boat ride in Nihn Binh, he said the boat rides take 1.5-2 hours.  When all of our group assembled after 2 hours, he was nowhere to be found for another 30 minutes.  He sited \"I told you it takes about 2 hours\" as his reason for being 30 minutes late in his return.  At every stop, he seemed to pride himself on being first to arrive/leave and that we were back in the city early.  None of the other patrons tipped him.  \n\nThe guide we had the next day to Ha Long Bay was wonderful.  The cruise and food were amazing.  All the crew were very accommodating of our family's needs and supporting the children's eating habits well.  My only complaint was that there was too much food!  Another issue was that the boat that we were on was no where nearly as beautiful as the boat pictured on the website. My husband, who works as a director, who is trying to get a cruise company as a client, was very disappointed that the boat was not similar to the one pictured.\n\nOur guide in Ho Chi Minh who took us to the Cu Chi tunnels was incredible!  He was knowledgeable, fun, accommodating, helpful and a really great guide! His English was excellent!\n\nOur guide of the Mekong Delta was very good as well.  He was very knowledgeable.

Correspondence prior to going on tour was good and all questions and requests on our booking were tended to promptly. We have a penchant for history, culture, food, and great sights, and Ms. Lily made sure everything was thought through beforehand. \nHanoi was an excellent starting point and we're glad we chose to arrive in Hanoi then work our way down south. Just a heads up, if you're planning on visiting Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum, chances are you'll have to wait on line for hours for a 60 second view of his body. So if the weather doesn't permit or you just wanna skip the waiting time, you'd better tour the grounds and go mid-week instead of the weekends. \nThe little town of Hoi An seems to be everyone's favorite given the fact that it is quite crowded with tourists. It was magnificent at night time, though, with plenty of cheap beers and tasty nibbles.\nHo Chi Minh City is pretty much a matter of taste. It wasn't really our cup of tea. Although, If you're a fan of cityscapes, bars, and nightlife, you'd probably find the dynamic energy of Saigon infectious. And culture vultures might be interested in visiting the War Remnants Museum and Cu Chi Tunnels."}]},{"name":"Vietnam 11 Days 10 Nights North to South or Vice Versa","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"We have run into a problem at airport my passport was only valid for 3 months and they didn’t let us travel as our plans.

Last minute changes to tour and i was on private city tour on Ho Chinh Minh which means tour finishes early. Flight booked from saigon was 8pm and tour guide drop me at 3pm. So have to wait long at airport with no many facilities. Reached Hanoi at midnight(all food shops get closed) as flight was delayed too by 1 hour. Went to hotel and slept straight away. Halong Bay was good and cruise was fantastic. Drop back at airport on time. Overall it was average.

Food was great, as was the pretour service. The drive from Can Tho to Rach Gaia is a bit rough but was helped by the comfortable car and a nice coffee break. The tunnels are good and you get to choose between a good range of automatic rifles and heavy machine guns to shoot. I chose a m16 and an m60 but there is a carbine, ak47 and a couple of others. The ammo is very expensive though at 60,000 for 10 bullets. The war museum is one of the best parts, I learned loads and the traps and chemical weapons (agent orange) engaged my morbid curiosity. \nGreat tour, I’d definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"3.5","review":"I can’t remember guides names but one was excellent the other was difficult to understand, but I am a bit deaf.

It’s a series of individual tours set up by Vietnam Travel Top, not a 10 day tour with the same guide or group of people. We liked this format as everything from accommodations to transportation to tours to most meals were already accounted for. But it also allowed us to have our own free time and not be on a 100% scheduled trip the entire time. All of our guides at each place were wonderful! The only place we didn’t particularly care for was our hotel in Ho Chi Minh. It was fine overall, but we had A/C problems and a couple other minor issues. Otherwise, all the accommodations were great!\n\nLeon and Steven were both very communicative and easy to get a hold of when we had questions about pick-up times, etc. The only recommendation I would make is if they could give a printed itinerary at the beginning of the trip with pick-up times and names of accommodations, as it’s not exact compared to the sample itinerary posted on TourRadar. That being said, I understand that that may not be possible as each individual tour company may not confirm times until the day before. \n\nOverall we had a wonderful trip and really enjoyed meeting all the various guides and drivers."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"We had a great experience in Vietnam and can highly recommend Vietnam Travel Top for all tour needs in Vietnam.

If this is what you are looking for then go asia travel did a good job.  However, if you are looking for a group tour, you will not find it here.  This was not clear in the information provided on the tourradar site or in any of my communication with go asia travel.  I caution others to be sure to ask the right questions so that they know what they are getting."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Highly recommended and would go through Go Asia again for my next holiday! \n\nI had originally thought the tour was with one group from day 1 to day 10, and one tour guide, however the \"tour\" actually consists of separate individual tours, with different groups of people. As a solo traveller I wasn't sure how this would work out, however it turned out to be perfect! On each of the tours I did (Halong Bay overnight, MySon, Mekong Delta and Cu Chi tunnels) each tour guide was fantastic and made sure I felt comfortable and was enjoying my time. The hospitality in Vietnam is extremely friendly and caring! \n\nEach of the tour guides I had were great at providing information about Vietnam and the attraction to us, and happy to answer any questions we had. I was very impressed with their English and they even taught us some Vietnamese! They cared for each person on the tour group and made sure it was suitable for us. \n\nThe accommodation was great (I was on the 3 star package), spacious rooms, toiletries and towels provided, always in perfect locations and in the main area therefore never had any issues getting back to the hotels. Also the staff again were extremely caring and friendly. \n\nEach of the hotels had breakfast, which was plentiful, and on the days I had a tour there would be lunch included (sometimes dinner depending on the times). The hotels being in the main areas meant that when there wasn't a tour on it was very easy to find food. \n\nThere were two tours which finished around 2pm, and for this one's, Go Asia had booked lunch, however this was separate to the actual tour, so I ended up being dropped of at a restaurant by myself! This was slightly strange and it wasn't well explained what was going on and whether I choose my own food or there is a set menu. However I messaged my Go Asia operator about it and he replied straight away explaining what was going to happen. I probably would have preferred to be able to find my own place for lunch considering I was a solo traveller! But the food was very tasty.\n\nMy Go Asia operator, Mike Nguyen, was extremely helpful and friendly! He responded quickly to my queries and was more than happy to answer my questions and also provide assistance and advice. When I decided to change my tour a bit he organised it all so I didn't have to worry about anything. \n\nEach of the journeys between locations is also organised, and pick ups from the airport/train station was easy to find and prompt. Not having to worry about a single thing on this holiday was a bliss! \n\nWould definitely do again!"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Fantastic! The itinerary consists of separate individual tours, so you're with different people on each of the tours, and the rest of the time is personal time. I wasn't clear of this at first but it ended up being absolutely fine, as every journey and every part of the itinerary that isn't a day/overnight tour is explained very clearly.\n\nEach of my individual tours (Halong Bay overnight, MySon tour, Mekong Delta and Cu Chi tunnels) was very well organised and with tour guides who were very knowledgeable and able to answer all our questions. \n\nThe hotels were great (I was on 3 star) and reception staff always so friendly and happy to offer suggestions of what to do during the free time.\n\nThe only shock was to me was when one of my driver's was on his phone the whole time driving! Coming from a country where that's not allowed, it was a bit of a shock, however that could just be for me.\n\nThere were two meals which weren't part of the day tour we were on, but an additional extra the itinerary included for after the day tour, and as it wasn't part of the day tour it meant sometimes I was the only one dropped off at a restaurant! Also that was probably the only bit that wasn't clear about what to do, as in wasn't sure if there was a set menu or I just order. But the organisers of the itinerary are extremely helpful and I would be able to contact mine with any questions and get a fast response such as in this situation. \n\nThe GoAsia coordinators are fantastic, so responsive and really want this experience to be well suited to each person. \n\nWould definitely do again!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Trip was all we expected and much more.\nPeople were friendly helpful and genuinely interested to make sure our experience was one to remember.\nThe sites were spectacular and diverse from north to south from rural setting to major cities.\nDriving by the local is something you can't discribe you need to see it."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Mike of - Go Asia Tours - did a great job of planning our itinerary \nThe tour was well paced with many interesting sites - some were totally awesome - e.g. The caves in Ha Long Bay - totally awesome "},{"rating":"5.0","review":"We have just returned back from Vietnam.

The guides were all very nice and smiling but it was a stuggle  to understand some of them sometimes due to their poor English. The accommodation were ok, actually better than expected, the hotel in Da Nang was the nicest, too bad it was only for one night. The hotel in Ho Chi Ming was the worst, poor internet and oldest, but very central. \nThe breakfasts at the hotels were ok, the lunches very easy. The last one was actually very good! Unfortunately they don’t include any drinks (water on the busses) witch is stupid, drinks are cheap though. All the lunches are served in sharing plates with no cutlery, I thought that was disgusting and had to point it out several time (note that 90% of the people on the tour is wearing masks due to the corona virus and is very hysteric, but when it comes to food they all put their chopsticks and forks into the sharing plates! Disgusting! Definitely an improvement potential there). The lunch at Ba Na Hills was a very big buffet with drinks and everything! \nAll together it was a very good experience  to see lots of things around Vietnam! It’s worth to mention that a rappresentative of the company came to say hello to us at the hotel  the day before the trip started with a little gift and her contact in case we should need it during the trip.

As a solo traveler with only a short time in Vietnam, I feel this was the best way for me to see these incredible parts of Vietnam.  This made the long bus rides and average food worth it to me.  At the end of my tour I was greeted by one of the supervisors and she checked in with me about my trip.  She even gave me a little farewell token.  I feel that the communication and people with this travel group were professional and really amazing.

The homestays were definitely a highlight of the trip. My one negative would be that although the trip was advertised as a 10 day trip, the only activity on ‘Day 1’ was a group meeting and the final day was the day everyone left so I think it would be more realistic to advertise as an 8 day tour so that people can plan their travel arrangements accordingly- I ended up having 2 days either side of the trip in Hanoi as I had assumed we’d have activities on each of the 10 days. \n\nBut apart from that, everything was excellently organised, of a high quality and again Loc was a brilliant guide."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Great tour long bus trips were hard Accomodation better than expected\n2nd day trek was too short"}]},{"name":"VIETNAM COLLECTION 1 - Vibrant Vietnam 10 Days","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"I just recently have this package tour with my families in this September and we are 100% satisfied with everything this company did to us.

He failed to ask or even check if the AC in the buses could be switched off.\n\n On the last evening Phat had to attend to a family emergency and promptly cancelled the group dinner booking at Hungry Hanoi without informing any of the group members.\n\n Last Phat confirmed my transfer from the hotel to the airport but on the day we needed to leave for the airport the transfer shuttle never arrived."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Thao was such a great guide!

There was a good balance of organised activities and free time  which our guide would suggest options or you could do your own thing. Our guide Bien was fantastic sharing his knowledge and stories that gave us a deeper insight into his culture. I suggest travel light- it only costs a dollar or two to have your washing done every few days- and leave room for souvenirs. Clothes are very cheap to buy. Buy or have it tailored in Hoi An. Highlight was the overnight cruise on Halong Bay -a calming end to a busy fun filled tour. I would highly recommend travelling with Intrepid and am looking at other tours they offer in Asia.

Thanh Vo is an excellent tour guide, exhibits a true love of Vietnam. Hanoi & Saigon (HCMC) are chaotic metropolitan cities, I strongly suggest purchasing advance transfers plus pre/post hotels to adjust from USA long haul flights and lay overs. Enlist the services of an on line Visa service-they are professional and essential to clearing customs at International arrivals. Enjoyed the more rural/natural aspects of Vietnam since we met authentic people, amazing foods,smells and landscapes. Halong bay boat trip (plus caves) has been criticized for heavy commercialism and congestion but I found the boat had two extremely creative chefs, comfortable cabins and a peaceful vibe. Bike riding outside of Hue and sampling rice wine, meeting a guitar playing entrepreneur/veteran from the Vietnamese war with Cambodia was fascinating. Appreciated the historical aspects and museum displays within the imperial city. Definitely do an optional home dinner with a local family, she was an excellent cook and you will gain great insights to the aspirations of the next generation of Vietnamese people, All supplemental guides to Thanh on specific locations were professional, all motor coach driver extremely safe and prompt. Overnight train brought back many great memories of traversing the rural landscapes of Africa yet so unique to Vietnam's rice fields, villages, memorials and temples. Too much time in Hoi Ann, but mostly because I am not a shopper. Loved the Mekong Delta boat ride and visiting remote tropical villages. Overall Intrepid did an excellent job in executing a difficult, multi faceted and fast paced tour of Vietnam.

The accommodation were closer to 3 stars but NOT when you consider I traveled on the \"comfort\" trip and kept running into travelers on \"basic\" or \"original\" that stayed in better hotels more centrally located.  We also noticed that they consistently traveled in nicer buses. Our overnight train was on a horrific car on New Year's Eve and we ended up running into travelers on the basic trip staying in a much higher class car.\n\nLast I want to warn people about the new tip kitty.  Sounds like a great idea to ensure local guides are tipped, however it apparently is a method to compensate the Trip guide at the local guide's expense.  Very sad as the local guides don't receive the same type of compensation or restaurant kickbacks and now the Trip Guide literally takes money out of their pocket.  Please do NOT participate in a tip kitty without a traveler administering the tips (careful as one of our guides had us do this but with a sealed envelope) or just say that you prefer to give out your own tips.  It turns tips from optional to compulsory and moves the funds from locals to trip guides.  WATCH OUT if your guide is Tho Nguyen.  You'll recognize him as he dressed as if he wore dress slacks, sports coats and dress shoes every day.  He didn't even try to hide his \"ill gotten gains!\"\n\nI would recommend the trip but with another tour company"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Really nice country shown by a really knowledgeable and nice guide.

Giang was an outstanding guide with a deep knowledge of the country and it's history, the regional foods and their preparation, as well as insights from his life in Vietnam. Giang managed a diverse group of guests, anticipating our needs and with good humor responding to our varied demands. His outgoing nature made him a friend to everyone on the tour and opened doors for us to meet local folks. For example, because Giang had befriended his wife, we had dinner in the home of a retired Vietnamese officer who served in the American war.  The evening was both a delightful opportunity to eat a home cooked meal and a thought provoking discussion of the war and it's aftermath. \n\nAs an added benefit, he is an award-winning photographer and generously spent time offering suggestions and tips to improve the photographs of the shutterbugs in the group. \n\nI could go on and on about Giang and his skill as a travel guide.

My family appreciated their suggestion and we accepted the new itinerary. All of the accommodations and transportation were organized as promised.\n\n\nOn the first day, the driver was on time and drove us to the intended destination (family house not hotel as requested by me weeks prior to the start of the tour). My family and I got ourselves to the hotel when it was time for check-in. Process was simple, just show your passports. The second day we joined a group of 8 people (including tour guide), we all had lunch together before being dropped off at the hotel again. \n\nThe third day, a driver picked us up to head to the airport to fly to Hanoi. Upon arrival, the next tour guide and driver gave us a private view (dependent on your arrival into Hanoi) around the 36 streets/wards of Hanoi before being dropped off at the hotel.The guide was very informative while explaining the history of the city. We felt comfortable with this guide as he was friendly and helpful when it came to our questions. \n\nThe next day was our trip to Ha Long Bay where we would meet the next and final group as we traveled by shuttle bus to the city of Ha Long. We liked our new guide too, he was full of character and very accommodating with us. The staff of Garden Bay Cruise was lovely and were great hosts. We felt respected and noticed all of their efforts in making the guests feel comfortable. The rooms were surprisingly spotless and food was much better than expected.

We were picked up on time from Hanoi airport by our guide, Tang Kim Dung she took us to the hotel and made sure that everything was in order before she left. Next day she was there on time. Very knowledgable and efficient, she gave good explanation of everything. I must mention the driver, ver polite, he kept an immaculate car and always had fresh water for us, a lovely touch. We were picked up on time for our trip to Halong Bay, all went well but I am not sure what we received for our additional $25 per person for the galla evening, not even a glass of champers at midnight, some cheap stuff that wasn't drinkable. Please don't get me wrong the crew were great but I sensed that quite rightly they were always great. Guide then picked us up for our trip to Sapa, again she ensured we were safely on board and settled before she left. Sapa - well this was a bit of a disappointment. Our itinerary stated a trek, what we got was a 2 hour walk on a proper road, yes there were interesting things to see, but there were lots of people on the same road. We then stopped for lunch for a hour, we had anticipated further walking in the afternoon but our guide dropped us off at 12.50. The rest of the day was free but there is nothing to do in Sapa if your not out trekking, very disappointing. The guide was informative but also annoying as he was often on his mobile phone. Next morning the guide suggested leaving at 7 am, from our experience the day before I said 7.30. In reality we could have left at 9. Lovely 2 hour drive, we stopped at the market, which is like any other market in Asia , so no need to have 2 hrs there. We couldn't do the river trip as the river was too dry due to the dam restricting the flow of water. So we were back in our destination by 12 MD with 9 hours to fill in, in a City that has nothing for tourists. Here our guide was very helpful and got us a room in a hotel but it was a long wait, so we did two ten hour trips on a train for 2 hours walking, a three hour drive the next day. ( which was enjoyable) and 45 mins at a market. Please sort this out for others. I am sure that others have said this but Sapa is now very commercialised and you may want to suggest other things for the itenary. I hope you find this useful, it is intended to be.

Ultimately, Intrepid did not find another family to go during our tour period, and it was too late for me to change dates.  As a single parent with a 10 year old while we had an amazing guide, without companionship of other families for a variety of reasons the trip was more work for me than was promised and a bit lonely.   Additionally, there were several side trips we just couldn't take as they were usually booked for groups only.  Our guide really saw this was a problem and worked hard to find compromises for these activities and I really appreciated that.  My suggestion is if it is important for you to have other families along in the tour just don't book too early. Wait until there are enough during the time period you wish to go so this won't be an issue.  "},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Where do I start?

Not only was he a wealth of information but very funny, interesting and great with the kids.  He took us to some amazing places to eat and always made the journey by bus although sometimes long seem short.  We even enjoyed the Karaoke on the bus very much.  The tour was well organized with a mix of tours and some free time as well.  The amount of time spent at each destination was well thought of and perfect for this tour with a mix of things for both the adults and children, especially the water puppet show, markets, optional cooking class, bike rides, cyclos, tuk tuk, boat rides and the water theme park on the last day. It was so sad when it came to an end and we all had to say goodbye but we have make some lasting friendships from this trip.

We arrived in Cat Ba at 3pm and left at 7am the next morning so it wasn' t really worth coming there. The entire third day was transportation so I wouldn't call it a three days tour.

I’m so glad I booked as it made the start of my travels so relaxing and hassle free. The only problem I had when going ahead to book was that being a single traveller you couldn’t book a shared room which meant an additional charge. I contacted Manh and explained I couldn’t afford to do the trip paying for private hotel rooms so he then changed the tour for me to shared hostel rooms which made it cheaper which was a bonus. I also wanted to add the golden bridge tour which he arranged into my 12 day tour. \nBy far the the best places was Halong Bay and Hoi An. \n\nThe whole tour was so well organised I highly recommend booking  Vietnam real tour.

This was classed as an upgrade and I assumed it meant upgrade to 4 star but it doesn’t it  means upgrade to a window.\n-Sadly be prepared to see lots of heartbreaking pollution. The sky’s are gray, the beautiful Mekong tragically brown with none stop garbage floating down. Do take pictures of the rubbish and post and/or send to Vietnam tourism they need to know they will loose tourists! Bottled water!! Try where you can to limit it, refill where possible. I was boiling the kettle each evening  and filling up in the morning when the kettle was cold.\n\n-Manh was very helpful, readily available to contact on watts app at any time. As we had paid in one the hotels for an upgrade (Literally no room to walk around the bed) he compensated us for that cost and ensured we had a very good room in our last hotel."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Great tour operator. Mr Manh from Vietnam Real Tour has always been very responsive to every question I had before and during the trip. The tour is overall very well organized with free time in every place I visited, giving me the chance to discover and live in my own way rather than being constantly guided in every step. BIG thumbs up for this.\nAll the daily tours included are operated by different local companies and I shared them with different people every time.\nThey picked my up at the front door of the hostel within the time frames advised and the guides were actually born within that area so it was nice to hear their stories and points of view.\nI also had a chance to have lunch at one the guide's home as part of a tour I did, giving me the chance to breathe a bit of their daily life. Another BIG thumbs up.\n\nOverall I had the chance to be a \"backpacker\" without the stress of taking daily decisions (accomodation,tours,domestic travels...). This helped a lot in enjoying this experience in the best way possible."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"My wife and I recently returned from a month long trip visiting Cambodia, Vietnam and Hong Kong. \n  For the Vietnam portion of the trip we used the services of Vietnam Real Tours. Our trip was essentially the 15 Days Highlight Vietnam ( Tour Radar.com) with some minor modifications.\nThroughout the trip, our co-ordinator, Mr Manh Tatien, was readily available by phone or WhatsApp for any issues or questions. We were able to request some minor changes to the itinerary to suit our own interests, something not possible with most other agencies.\n All in all, we were provided with a fantastic tour covering almost everything on our wish list. There was adequate down time in most cities, allowing us the choice of relaxing or exploring on our own.\nThe hotels, for the most part were all centrally located or an easy taxi ride away from the main tourist areas. The included tours were well organized with guides who seemed well versed in their subject matter. \n   We chose the overnight sleeper train for the trip from Hue to Hanoi- an interesting way to see the country once the sun comes up. However, I would not suggest it for someone who is a light sleeper as the ride is rather bumpy compared to European trains.\n  Hanoi has lots to see so I would definitely suggest extending your trip if time permits. Again Mr Tatien had no issues with extending our stays in both Hanoi and Saigon, providing free transfers in both cities. Breakfast was supplied by all hotels and usually included a good variety of foods including Pho which is an interesting way to start your day. Very satisfying lunches were included on days when we joined local tours and on other days we had the opportunity to sample local dishes on our own.\n All in all, I would highly recommend this company for longer trips such as ours or even single day trips for those travelling on their own who are looking for a local guide service.\n  Price wise, I do not think we could have found a better option without sacrificing comfort and hotel quality.

When I arrived to Sapa  on a bus there was no one for me to follow to the hotel. My agent and the company weren't responding when I texted and called. Everyone from my bus was taken to their hotels but me. About 20 minutes later finally someone showed up and put me back of his scooter and took me to my hotel. \nThe first day of half day walking tour was guided by a lovely local gal for a local couple and myself. Unfortunately I didn't speak Vietnamese therefore my interaction with them was quite unenjoyable. I arrived back to the hotel and hoping to find other fellow travelers but none was seen. I had a late lunch and dinner in the massive dining room without a single soul. \nContrary to the intinery there wasn't any \"group evening activity and social\".\nI was a solo traveler and it was a \n quite creepy staying. \nThe following day I joined a pretty nice group of people to trek further Sapa villages which I enjoyed. However on our way back in a van our driver became angry at another driver from the oncoming traffic he broke out a huge machedi underneath his seat and ran after the other driver. Several of us were getting ready to leave the scene and walk back to hotel but the other driver gave in the conflict. When we returned to our hotel and voiced the incident the trip agent blew us off saying \"it was the other guy's fault\".\n\nThe trip was orchestrated poorly, communication wasn't  there and professionalism didn't exist."},{"rating":"3.0","review":"Sales manager wasn't kind and no respect to costumer."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Great adventures.

It was easy to communicate with the office staff before the trip and Mr. Danny was very helpful (and responsive) when we had some issues once we were on the tour itself: when a storm canceled our Ha Long Bay trip, Mr. Danny extended our stay in Hanoi and set up alternate tours for us as well as keeping us updated when one of our guides in another city was running late.\n\nIn Hanoi and HCMC the daily excursions were with larger groups rather than a private tours like Hue, Hoi An, and Phu Quoc. Legend Travel finds local providers for the tours (and airport pickups) and most of the guides have a deep knowledge of their tour sites and had a decent to excellent ability to communicate in English with us. Tours often included lunch but tended to be at slightly whitewashed tourist style. I may have been a little picky/critical since I grew up with Vietnamese food.\n\nThe hotels we were booked at were mostly good to quite excellent and in walking distance of local attractions. We were in different hotels than listed for Hanoi (decent hotel) and HCMC (poor experience) so keep in mind that the tier of room may differ from the hotel's descriptions. The breakfast included on the schedule was the hotel breakfast buffet.\n\nI imagine that we would have been able to book and build our own tour with some savings but that would require a lot more time and legwork so we were very happy with what was included in our tour package.

There were parts of the tour that were brilliant, thanks to the awesome guides and there were also parts of the tour that were absolute rubbish, which I put down to terrible tour attraction selection and indifferent guides.\n\nThis tour is not run by one company for the duration of the 15 days, rather it is 5 or 6 different tour companies sub contracted to provide the tours in each region visited. Our tour was billed as a 3 star 15 day family experience, and for the most part we received the 3 star food and accommodation we paid for. Unfortunately in Can Tho the travel agent booked us with YTC tours. \n\nThis company was horrible, and I rate them one star out of 5. We did the 2 day tour of the Mekong, and the boat tour took us through a canal that was worse than an open sewer. Not the Vietnam I want to see. When the rower extorted a tip from us, we relented and paid, only to have the 100 000 VND thrown into the bottom of the boat as it wasn't enough. All the other guides we had suggested this amount was the right tipping amount, but obviously not for these people. \n\nLunch on the first day was a bowl of rice and a bit of rubbery meat??? Some on the tour (Japanese???) were provided lunch that looked awesome, but we weren't served the same food. Our tour itinerary stated water was provided as complimentary, but we were made to pay.  The family accommodation provided was in a grotty zero star back packers. The mattresses' were thin low density foam, stained with god knows what, no sheets or pillows were provided, as it probably was assumed we would have sleeping bags. Security was dismal, the room itself was filthy and looked like it had never been cleaned. \n\nNeedless to say, I moved our family into a decent hotel around the corner from where we were staying. The tour guide was not happy about this, but I paid for 3 stars, not the local back packers. Other people on the tour did the same as us and moved to another hotel at their own expense, once they saw exactly where they had been accommodated. \n\nThe next morning, our family returned to the backpackers to continue with the tour. As breakfast had already been paid for,I availed myself of a juice and a coffee. I was then given a bill for my beverages. I said this was part of the breakfast I had already paid for, and they said as I didn't stay the night, I wasn't entitled to breakfast, even though I had already paid up front. Talk about gouging. I didn't pay of course.\n\nYTC Tours almost ruined my holiday. They were cheap, nasty and should be avoided at all costs. It's a shame that one company can almost undo all the hard work the rest of the companies put in to make my holiday a great experience."}]},{"name":"Vietnam Super Highlights - 15 Days Trip","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Excellent -everything was really well organised from airport pickups, trips, hotels, food & guides."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"100% reliable\n\n\n\nI went on a 15 days round trip with this travel agency.

Also we could use the money to upgrade our means of transportation and dining options, so it's a win-win situation. Also, we decided to book with them not only because of the price, but also because they had been a great help and really earned our trust.\nEven from the very first day of our tour, we were convinced that we had made the right decision. All the drivers and guides we had were always on time and professional. Not a single time were we left attended. We were even requested by the company to review our guides in order to assist them in improving their services. Of course we had our favorite ones but all of them were very good in general. The weather wasn't always in our favor and sometimes got in the way but Thanh (our booking consultant) always managed to rearrange our schedule seamlessly, like that one time when it was raining heavily and we couldn't make it on time for our Water Puppet show.\nI would totally recommend Top Vietnam Travel for their excellent support!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Choosing a Vietnamese travel company is either a hit or a miss for many reasons.

She accommodated all of our requests leading up to the trip, and even went to great lengths to help us extend our stay in Hoi An and reschedule the next day's entire program in Hue simply because we wanted to add My Son Sanctuary to our schedule at the last minute.\nWe could not have asked for better support and services."}]},{"name":"Hanoi & Halong Bay- 4 Days North of Vietnam","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Thank you so much for such a wonderful well planned holiday all my friends will be recommending you to all their family and friends"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"The tour process was awesome, just need to read itinerary as we thought it as a three day cruise, when it was 1 and the other off the boat.1 night on the boat is not enough yet others were on there 2 nights.

Right from our first communications after booking this tour, during and after our trip, they were always available to answer any queries from us. \nJenny, who was our contact was amazing, she deserves a 10☆ rating all by her self. \nThe tour was incredibly well organised, all pick-ups were on time and each tour was so well organised with fantastic guides. None of the groups were big, which suited us and on one of our tours there were only the two of us and the guide. All of the guides were excellent. \nEach day is a new adventure in Vietnam and we're aware it's a well trodden route but it's so well done and we felt so thrilled to be part of it for a while. Yes, it has very busy towns and cities with scooters coming towards you from every angle but you soon  learn how to manage.  \nThe only mistake we made was that we booked separately, a guided food tour one evening. It really is not value for money ($25 each) and the food was not good at all. You can get much better food for a fraction of the price.

I think that our tour guide Kien made the trip amazing. He was clear and concise, entertaining, and provided lots of useful information. I enjoyed his talks about Vietnam history, culture, and people. He was always so helpful. I felt like he was taking very good care of us throughout the entire trip. I can't say enough about Kien! As for the itinerary, there were two days of travel that I found tiring. One was the overnight train sleeper train ride to Hue. It's not easy for me to sleep on a train with three other people in the same berth. Still, I am glad I tried it as now I can say that I've done it. Plus, the people in my cabin were lovely and nice. There was one day when we had to wake up at 330 am to catch a plane to Ho Chi Minh City. The trip notes referred to this as \"an early morning flight to Ho Chi Minh City.\" I guess it didn't sink in just how tiring that day would be. After the flight, we took a three hour bus ride to the Mekong Delta. If you add up the time spent waiting in the airport and the time sitting on the plane, I think we must have sat for at least 8 hours that day. I am normally a very active person and one thing I found difficult about this tour was getting enough exercise. I felt like we sat a lot of the time, e.g. on a tour bus, at the restaurants, on boats, on a plane, on the train, etc. Having said all this, I don't know how I could have seen all the things that I was able to see in 10 days. I really felt like I saw Vietnam on this trip. And I also felt that the tour was well organized, all except for the first and last hotel. We weren't told which hotel we would stay at in Ho Chi Minh so I could not book my hotel for the next day (we stayed an extra day) with knowledge of where we would be moving from. I also did not know the first hotel until much closer to the tour date. By then, I had already booked a hotel in Hanoi in the centre of town. TOURRADAR will book additional nights stays before and after the tour in the tour hotel but I found the cost to be much higher than what I was able to find on BOOKING.COM. All in all, I give this tour a five star rating because I don't think much can be improved given the itinerary. One additional comment - it was an unexpected joy to get a pair of pants tailored in Hoi An. I wish I had scoured magazines for pictures of clothes that I like in advance to have them ready when I arrived. I chose to get pants tailored only at the last minute and was pleased with the results. So inexpensive and the pants fit perfectly! It's best to order the clothes on the first day to have time to make adjustments if adjustments are needed."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Guides were great.

The pace was good and provision was made for people struggling with the more strenuous parts. There is quite a lot of walking on rough terrain. The guides were knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. The hotels are good or very good. The coaches were good. Food was good with non spicy options for the less adventurous in the group. Vietnam and Cambodia, especially, have lots of litter, motorbikes and smelly bits along with magnificent tourist attractions. We normally go solo but an \"On The Go\" tour of this part of the world had the benefits of good guides and organisation.

Accomodation was great, guides were excellent especially Long on the Mekong Delta Tour.  The only disappointment was the itinerary indicated the first day included a tour of Ho Chi Minh City but when we contacted the Tour Operator they told us we needed to book this ourselves.  I have reviewed the brochure and it definitely indicates this is included even down to describing in detail the itinerary for the tour of the city on Cyclo.  In the end we organised a tour through the hotel and felt like we were ripped off by that tour operator.  We think you need to discuss this with Vietnam Adventure Tours and amend your brochure to make it clear it is not an inclusion."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The hotel was in a great location, and the tour was everything we hoped for.

The company arranged for an extra night accommodation and airport pick up and drop off. Extremely easy to work with. Punctual, flexible and approachable. Totally reliable.

Her English was perfect.,her style easy friendly fun with an excellent sense of humour approachable, organised related to everyone in the group even with diversity in cultures. Loved it.

Good food. Hotel good standard with very helpful staff.

You will have quite a lot of free time on your own (massages, shopping, exploring the town) \n\nSome negatives: \nWe lost our guide in Cat Cat Village and had to make our own way back to Sapa. That meant I had to get on the back of a motorcycle, which I had no intention of doing. \n\nDuring our walk to the villages on day 2, some of the local Hmong ladies had walked to Sapa that morning and walked with us back to their village. While I did appreciate the help on some of the difficult parts of the walk and to avoid slipping, I did feel obligated to buy goods from 2 of them when we arrived at their village. A 3rd lady began pressing for sales too which really made the whole experience feel like a shakedown. I had no problem giving them money as a thank you but this felt forced and excessive. \n\nI did ask to be brought back early, to bus that brought us back to Sapa, to get a seat near front. It ended up that the bus was waiting for me approx 20mins late by the time I was dropped off."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Our Sapa tour was fantastic, it was a great mix of culture food and activities.

I arrived off the bus not knowing where I was supposed to go and basically having to orchestrate the whole 3 days myself. It did not feel as if I was able to relax a great deal. The hotel was half-decent and the restaurant lacked something to be desired (it was dirty and some of the food was cold when it should have been hot). Leon, however, was somewhat helpful and met my requests after I gave reasons why I was making them. I was not originally going to stay in a home stay according to Leon, but he made it happen for me and it was one of the best experiences I’ve had while in Vietnam. That being said, considering the price, I would not buy a package next time and would simply have organized everything myself knowing what I do now."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Vietnam Travel Top ensured our recent trip to Vietnam ran smoothly.

From start, tour manager, Mahn from Vietnam Real Tours contacted me and continued to provide excellent communication throughout the tour. We wished to update the tour to provide extra days in a couple of places along the way.

The tour was excellent, providing flexibility with dates on each component from pick up from airport to hotel to day trip and continuation of journey. All happened so seamlessly as organised by Mahn which took any stress out of bookings to fit within 15 day stay without visa. The hotels booked on the tour by Mahn were thoughtfully located to explore areas and of the best quality. I had an injury whilst in tour and Mahn arranged an upgrade for us to make me comfortable having to miss a day trip. I thank him for his care with this. The sight seeing trips arranged for us were great too. Good English speaking and variety to give us taste of Vietnam. I normally arrange all components of a journey when travelling lots in SE Asia, to save cost. However, thought for short time, first time to Vietnam, it was easy to have independence of dates but everything arranged for us.

The tour was excellent, providing flexibility with dates on each component from pick up from airport to hotel to day trip and continuation of journey. All happened so seamlessly as organised by Mahn which took any stress out of bookings to fit within 15 day stay without visa. The hotels booked on the tour by Mahn were thoughtfully located to explore areas and of the best quality. I had an injury whilst in tour and Mahn arranged an upgrade for us to make me comfortable having to miss a day trip. I thank him for his care with this. The sight seeing trips arranged for us were great too. Good English speaking and variety to give us taste of Vietnam. I normally arrange all components of a journey when travelling lots in SE Asia, to save cost. However, thought for short time, first time to Vietnam, it was easy to have independence of dates but everything arranged for us.

As for the actual tour it was so well run for our group of 9 people (a mix of elderly as well as teens), with our own big tour bus (with some great music on some of them), excellent tour guides and very good hotels at each stop. The whole tour was so efficiently run. All we had to do was to basically wake up and each day's tour commenced; no worries about anything. The guides also assisted with great authentic street food and restaurant recommendations, and shopping suggestions. It was probably one of the most affordable holidays you can get, and the Vietnamese are such lovely people. Highlights included the Cu Chi tunnels, Mekong Delta, Halong Bay, charming town of Hue amongst others. And the food and coffee is to die for..............especially with a little condensed milk.

I'm not a jig travellers and I hate camping, but I knew I would find it hard in Vietnam because it's so different from Canada. But in the end, it wasn't too difficult. I love the history and I cultures and I loved the Imperial city and observe how they work here in Vietnam. The activities we did were excellent, the cooking class was a treat and the food was amazing.\n\nI particularly like Phong Nha, surrounded by the mountains, it was beautiful. I had so much fun in the dark cave and the water activities we did after.\nOne of the tourists had an accident there, and it seems that nobody there knew first aid, and it was a bit scary, but our guide Edna jumped in and with one of our group who has a doctor. In the end, all was well and such a relieve.\nThe castaways island was something that I never did before also, it was a bit overwhelming at first, but I had a lot of fun with our tour guide and the members of our groups. I think I misunderstood what was castaways island and wasn't prepared for the constant partying, but I know my limits so I went stopped when it was to much.\nAgain, I had a lot of fun dancing and drinking with my group mates \nDon't be surprised though, people are going there to party hard. \n\nFinally, what comes out of this for me, it's the time I spent with my groups and the fun we had with the activities, I feel I made friends and Edna, our tour guide, was a friend and a big sister to us or to me at least ❤️"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"I didn't know what expect from this trip!

We are so lucky for the beautiful weather that time, open top jeep was sick experience, the view is unbelievable and neve expected this would be awesome like this.

This was not the case, we got on the kayaks, moved 100m down from the boat and played, \"never have i ever\", and we directed to get back on to the boat, there was no time to explore and we did not see any caves or any monkeys.\n\nOverall, my trip was an amazing experience with TruTravels, I would recommend it to all my friends!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Papsi is the best!

Everything from the activities, information, support and the tour leader Phi made it the best vacation that I have been on so far. This kind of tour is so much better than other tours I have tried. And since I’m from Denmark and goes on tour with an English company, that tells you all you need to know, about you don’t find tours like this in Denmark. The tour leader Phi helped me with further traveling information and set me up with other tour guides, since I’m going to travel on my own after this tour. Phi was such a cool guy. It’s so cool that the tour guide is so much involved and is a part of the group. Can’t recommend Phi and Adam enough! Without these guys the experience would have been totally different. The group was unreal as well and I will without a doubt come back again and recommend the tour to other friends. This is my second tour and the tour keeps getting better and better. I can’t keep on recommending the tour guide, and since Phi knows the Vietnamese language, he also helped us a lot with communication with locals. Here I can mention moments like going for direction, restaurants, communication with the barber, etc. Adam is the funniest and coolest guy you will meet and I haven’t laughed as much as on this tour. Keep up the good work Adam and Phi!"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Joining a group that has established friendships was very difficult as it took a long time to feel comfortable with the original group. This is not Trutravels fault, but maybe a nudge or a brief ward could be given to those who did Vietnam South Tour. \nBa Na Hills is not on the original itinerary but I really enjoyed it there as there is something for everyone. The duck farm wasn't on the itinerary either but it was an absolute favorite of mine. Castaways was a good way to end the tour with everyone. Restaurant choices could be better. As a vegetarian, I feel my dietary requirements were met very well and I was always happy with the food offered to me. \nPapsi, He is a great leader , always made sure we were all okay and stayed together especially at Castaways. \n\nWe love you Papsi, we do!\nWe love you Papsi, we do!\nOhhhh Papsi we love you!!! <3"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Trutravels is a great company.

Traveling as two blonde girls I would highly recommend doing a group tour to see Vietnam as we felt safer in this country. It was so nice not having to worry about transport an accommodations as that is already taking care of for you. Traveling between each place was so stress free seeing Vietnam. One of my favorite places of the whole trip was th beach club Kahunas in Hoi An. Darrin was a really good tour guide an always wanted to make sure everyone was having a good time An safe. He was always up for hanging out an took us to some awesome places to eat. I felt like he’s was a really good tour guide. Cast Aways was so much fun thanks Tru Travels"},{"rating":"3.5","review":"The itinerary was fab, the group was fab. \nPinky did take us to some nice places that you wouldn’t necessarily have found had you been travelling on your own.\n\nBut sadly I can’t give her more than 2 stars. I feel there was a severe lack of communication, and almost zero motivation to get us having fun in the evenings, she would take us to a restaurant (a pretty expensive one too for example the American diner in Hue, I have no idea what indication we gave to want westernised food this was literally on day 3 I do not miss that food yet...) but then if she left after food, would not really recommend any bars except for the karaoke which was one of my fave nights but again we only went there because we had all suggested karaoke.\n\nThe trip was 100% made worth while by the Castaways experience, and sadly that was nothing to do with trutravels. The staff at castaways are second to none I would recommend them any day, and I’m just glad that it was booked through the tour so for that thank you TruTravels.\n\nIt makes me really sad to leave such a poor review as my previous tour with you guys was amazing. We had 3 tour guides and 27 guests and everyone’s needs were catered for, this tour had 11 and I somewhat felt like we had to push pinky for answers a lot and I felt very much the last to know everything, maybe that just speaks about myself but with so little guests I would have hoped that we . She knew a lot about Vietnam which was good for the informative parts but otherwise no recommendations for the free evenings at all and information regarding the hotels was lost, for example I had no idea what time we were supposed to be checking out on the last day and when asking wasn’t really given a set answer still. \n\nThis is nothing on Pinky’s own personality she is a lovely girl and she has not had any cross words with anyone, I just feel somewhat let down by the lack of leadership. \n\nI will probably book with trutravels again because I have so much love for you as a company, except I will make sure that I get a western tour guide so to limit the language barrier and communication issues."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Had a lot of fun on the tour with lots of brilliant people. The social side of the tour is fantastic, you make sure great friends that  will last a long time. Edna out tour guide was fun and helped us have a great time. Ninhvana was brilliant as was Castaways. My Highlight was the Hai Van Pass this had the fantastic views and was a great fun. To improve the trip it would be better if you could either had a Vietnamese tour guide as well, our tour guide Edna who had a bit knowledge of Vietnamese. This would help problem solving in the event of things going wrong.  It would also be good if you were notified in advance what things were included,i.e the abandoned waterpark.\nI love the Vietnam Explorer tour and would like to thank Edna for her help."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"This tour has been my favorite TruTravels tour.

After our mishop with there not being enough seat on the night bus and having to take the night train - I highly get to experience both bus and train, and it saved us coming at 6am. Train was good! The organization of this tour is the downfall. This was no reflection on our amazing tour guide Edna. I felt that was alot of wasting a round and not knowing what was  going on. Also, the book week, (especially Hoi An and Hanoi) the tour be 20/21 days and have more time or even a free day to explore the places further.\nThe activities were great."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"I think this tour had a fabulous mixture of culture and fun. A lot of packed in so I felt I got a great taste of Vietnam. I felt I had a lot of support throughout. My only complaint would be a day too long and night were was enough I believe. I found Ninhvana staff to be rude at times but obviously isn't the fault of TruTravels, generally the accomodations was a good standard + very comfortable.\nEdna was an amazing tour guide, she was very caring, attentive and made every effort to ensure we were okay and entertained. She dealt with the night bus issue well and was keen when she needed to be. Amazing food, Edna really made an effort to take us to a variety of places.\nOverall I've had the  best  couple of weeks and Trucrew for working it some of the best few weeks of my life."}]},{"name":"Complete Vietnam - 10 Days","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"Most 10 day tour was good.\nThe train journey shocked us.

The Hà Long Bay cruiseon 20-21st March 2019 was the highlight of this tour and the tour guide was very good.  The worse was the tour on 16 March 19 afternoon boat trip at Back Dang Station.  The boat was a run down fishing boat and smelly.  We went on board from a rubbish dump. The included meal of the boat trip was a plate of rice with some vegetable.  The trip made me feel like a refugee.  The overnight train trip on 15 March 2019 took 18.5 hours.  It was a complete waste of time.  The train and the toilet were unclean.

Very busy, lots to see and do"},{"rating":"3.5","review":"The guides in themselves were great, although we at times were felt rushed from site to site. In terms of organization, we have to point out the following: \n\nA common problem was that the guides ALWAYS arrived about half an hour earlier at the hotel, so some of them ended up angry chasing us as we were still having our breakfast. Be aware, the times that you are given on the itinerary are all over the place! \n\nNext, we were looking forward to see Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum, just to learn that it was closed that day. Did none of the organizers bother to look up opening times in advance?\n\nWe were always taken to restaurants were all the other tourists were having their lunch, which is understandable, but I found the many stops at some (quite aggressive) souvenir outlets more than annoying. You lose the will to have a look at anything when the shop assistant is a few steps behind you, asking what we want to buy. Not cool. \n\nAnother thing to complain would be the location of the hotel in Ho Chi Minh City. We were located in the Backpacker's district, which is extremely noisy and full of annoying street sellers.  \n\nAll in all the individual guides did a great job and we experienced a few special moments, but we would not do such trip again, as the program was too intensive and did not leave much time to relax. \n"}]},{"name":"Vietnam Snapshot","reviews":[{"rating":"4.5","review":"Phat was the perfect guide, knowledgeable, caring, approachable, responsible and entertaining."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Our 12 day Food Tour was excellent.

So each time I was with a different group of people and each mini tour had a different guide. There was quite a lot of time spent on the bus but it was worth it as the scenery was stunning. The organisation was very good and the Crossing Vietnam guide, Tracy, was excellent. She was very helpful and pleasant and did her best to make sure all the arrangements came together. When I left a bag on the overnight train, she managed to get it back for me and took it to my hotel. \nI would not advise a solo traveller to pay extra for a single room as 2 nights were spent on the train and 2 of the home stay nights were in a dormitory. In my opinion it was a waste of money."}]},{"name":"Northern Vietnam Discovery 7 Days","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"Excellent service from Tourradar, efficient, person centred and kept me well informed.\n\nWe were picked up on time from Hanoi airport by our guide,  Tang Kim Dung she took us to the hotel and made sure that everything was in order before she left. Next day she was there on time. Very knowledgable and efficient, she gave good explanation of everything. I must mention the driver, ver polite, he kept an immaculate car and always had fresh water for us, a lovely touch.\n\nWe were picked up on time for our trip to Halong Bay, all went well but I am not sure what we received for our additional $25 per person for the galla evening, not even a glass of champers at midnight, some cheap stuff that wasn't drinkable. Please don't get me wrong the crew were great but I sensed that quite rightly they were always great.\n\nGuide then picked us up for our trip to Sapa, again she ensured we were safely on board and settled before she left.\n\nSapa - well this was a bit of a disappointment. Our itinerary stated a trek, what we got was a 2 hour walk on a proper road, yes there were interesting things to see, but there were lots of people on the same road. We then stopped for lunch for a hour, we had anticipated further walking in the afternoon but our guide dropped us off at 12.50. The rest of the day was free but there is nothing to do in Sapa if your not out trekking, very disappointing. The guide was informative but also annoying as he was often on his mobile phone.\nNext morning the guide suggested leaving at 7 am, from our experience the day before I said 7.30. In reality we could have left at 9. Lovely 2 hour drive, we stopped at the market, which is like any other market in Asia , so no need to have 2 hrs there.\n\nWe couldn't do the river trip as the river was too dry due to the dam restricting the flow of water.\nSo we were back in our destination by 12 MD with 9 hours to fill in, in a City that has nothing for tourists. Here our guide was very helpful and got us a room in a hotel but it was a long wait, so we did two ten hour trips on a train for 2 hours walking, a three hour drive the next day. ( which was enjoyable) and 45 mins at a market. Please sort this out for others.\n\nI am sure that others have said this but Sapa is now very commercialised and you may want to suggest other things for the itenary.\n\nI hope you find this useful, it is intended to be.\n\nBest wishes\nJulie "}]},{"name":"Hoi An Motorcycle Tour to Saigon on Ho Chi Minh Trail via Kham Duc, Kon Tum, Buon Ma Thuot, Dak Mil, Dong Xoai","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Done a 6 day trip from Hoian to Saigon on Ho Chi Minh Trail.

If this were only a rating on him, I would give 5 stars! \n\nThat being said, whoever handles G Adventure's operations, needs to do a much better job. For the price paid, much better accommodations could have been provided. The 2 days in Koh Rong were honestly very bad. We drove across Cambodia to stay on a remote island with no AC and gaping holes in the floor of the accommodation. You could not even walk on the sand because of sand flies and you could not swim because of sea urchins and murky water. The trip to Koh Rong was unnecessary. It could be improved by changing the the accommodations or relocating to the nice side of the island which I hear has clear water. In Vietnam, the hostel we stayed in had BED BUGS. G adventures does not have a proper procedure for dealing with such events. I ended up leaving this accommodation with 3 of my friends. G adventures should have a procedure that makes the hotel/hostel accountable, instead of making us find our own accommodations."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Amazing experience that gave me the opportunity to visit a lot of wonderful places in a short time.

I consider myself extremely lucky to have been given Chan as my guide through the whole 20-day tour, as I don't believe I would have gotten the same experience with another guide. His communication over WhatsApp with the group was incredible, whether it was organising our plans for the day or making recommendations of sights and restaurants around the town. Not only this, but he also took part in the activities - he didn't simply do just what he was told to do by G Adventures, he went well above and beyond everything that needed to be done.

I think that our tour guide Kien made the trip amazing. He was clear and concise, entertaining, and provided lots of useful information. I enjoyed his talks about Vietnam history, culture, and people. He was always so helpful. I felt like he was taking very good care of us throughout the entire trip. I can't say enough about Kien! As for the itinerary, there were two days of travel that I found tiring. One was the overnight train sleeper train ride to Hue. It's not easy for me to sleep on a train with three other people in the same berth. Still, I am glad I tried it as now I can say that I've done it. Plus, the people in my cabin were lovely and nice. There was one day when we had to wake up at 330 am to catch a plane to Ho Chi Minh City. The trip notes referred to this as \"an early morning flight to Ho Chi Minh City.\" I guess it didn't sink in just how tiring that day would be. After the flight, we took a three hour bus ride to the Mekong Delta. If you add up the time spent waiting in the airport and the time sitting on the plane, I think we must have sat for at least 8 hours that day. I am normally a very active person and one thing I found difficult about this tour was getting enough exercise. I felt like we sat a lot of the time, e.g. on a tour bus, at the restaurants, on boats, on a plane, on the train, etc. Having said all this, I don't know how I could have seen all the things that I was able to see in 10 days. I really felt like I saw Vietnam on this trip. And I also felt that the tour was well organized, all except for the first and last hotel. We weren't told which hotel we would stay at in Ho Chi Minh so I could not book my hotel for the next day (we stayed an extra day) with knowledge of where we would be moving from. I also did not know the first hotel until much closer to the tour date. By then, I had already booked a hotel in Hanoi in the centre of town. TOURRADAR will book additional nights stays before and after the tour in the tour hotel but I found the cost to be much higher than what I was able to find on BOOKING.COM.  All in all, I give this tour a five star rating because I don't think much can be improved given the itinerary. One additional comment - it was an unexpected joy to get a pair of pants tailored in Hoi An. I wish I had scoured magazines for pictures of clothes that I like in advance to have them ready when I arrived. I chose to get pants tailored only at the last minute and was pleased with the results. So inexpensive and the pants fit perfectly! It's best to order the clothes on the first day to have time to make adjustments if adjustments are needed."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"A total blast!!..So much to see and well organized"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This was our first foray into group tours, so a little apprehension on our part.

If some parts of itinerary can be reviewed, it will be ideal, eg, the flight from Danang to HCM could be slightly later so the check in process would not be so rush & also able to meet the room check in time at hotel in HCM, to have a 2 nights Halong Bay cruise for better enjoyments & slightly some quiet moments on cruise, the Hanoi city tour could be on the 2nd day of the trip instead of the day to leave for Danang, and the HCM city tour in the afternoon could be done in a slower pace.

Searching on the Internet possible ways of travelling to and through Vietnam, I found this Amazing Vietnam Tour and I liked it immediately, because this tour offers exactly what I want and like: a comprehensive tour around the whole country, visit and sightseeing of two biggest and most important cities of Vietnam (but in some other cities as well), travelling to various parts of Vietnam with very different landscapes (cities and countryside, mountains, plains, streams and rivers and Mekong river delta, seaside and islands, beaches). This program also offers various aspects of Vietnamese life and society (traditional life and activities, modern life, reach history and fantastic heritage, traditional and modern art, religion and sacral buildings, variety of national minorities with their traditional costumes and handicrafts). Very impressive, shocking and very emotional is insight into Vietnamese recent history (struggle and victory in wars against very cruel invaders: Japan, France and especially the USA). Every visitor to Vietnam (especially those who were born after those wars) MUST visit War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City and Cu Chi tunnels. \n\nMy choice of Top Vietnam Travel and Amazing Vietnam Tour was the best I could do. The whole tour was very intensive, but also very interesting, informative and exciting. I had no constant group and a permanent tour leader. Almost every day I had other fellow - travellers and guides. It was a little strange, but the organization of the tour was fantastic. My tour organizer Rita cared about me constantly and very much. Even more than it is usual. Every evening she was sending me updated info about next day’s excursions. And my journey was passing smoothly and according to the program. I can only say one big \"Thank you, Rita\".\nAfter coming back from Vietnam, I am full of nice remembrance and only the best impressions. It was an unforgettable journey to Vietnam.\nVietnamese people are very kind and friendly and cordial to foreigners. I am delighted with two wonderful ladies from TVT: Ms. Vivian Le and Ms. Rita, who managed my trip and cared so much about me during my journey. I can say only all the best about TVT and these two ladies. They were much more than professional in managing my trip.\nMy recommendation: Go to Vietnam with Top Vietnam Travel.

We stayed there the first day, until all the others arrived. Then we started as mentioned in the tour itinerary our adventures and our travel.\nThe group was really friendly and open minded and wishes from the group could be fulfilled every time. We were a really young group (age 18-29) - it was fun all the time!\nEspecially the group leader helped us every time and showed us the best places we had to see. He made a brilliant job although we were such a large group and Vietnam was abroad for him too. Competing against him in poolbillard and basketball was a hard task but big fun between the activities. Thank you Papsi for everything!!

I was pleasantly surprised.  I am used to traveling solo and be on my own schedule, so this was a completely new experience for me.  I would first like to give credit to my team leader Edna Mendoza who was absolutely incredible and made sure we had fun, stayed safe and on track with our schedule.\nBooking the trip with a British company from the U.S. was actually pretty easy to do.  The price for the whole experience was wallet friendly and by far exceeded all my expectations.  The team was very responsive to my questions and concerns so I was confident booking with them.\nI spent one the my best vacations ever.  Edna was really incredible and started communicating with me well in advance of the tour and was always readily available to answer questions and address concerns.\nI was fortunate to be part of an incredible group of people, all with different backgrounds, which was fun.  \nI really had very unique experiences, from traveling for 5 to 10+ hours on a sleeper bus, to sharing 15-bed room in hostel in Ninhavana which was a very beautiful party location.  Walking the streets of Mui Ne, Hoi An, Nha Trang,  Saigon (to name a few) during the day and at night was quite exquisite.  Experiencing the hustle and bustle of Vietnam, from day life to nightlife was exactly what I was looking for.  Street food was the best and I always make it a point to eat as much of it as I can.  My best memory was coming back from a late outing and stopping at a street vendor's space to get some pho...I was the happiest girl in the world and ate the best pho I have ever tasted -thank you Edna for facilitating this experience and giving us the flexibility we needed to fully immerse ourselves.\nThere is so much to say, from taking an epic trip to see the \"hands\" (Golden Bridge) in Da Nang (riding cable cars forever to get there...lol..scary but thrilling experience), to eating the best Banh Mi (where Anthony Bourdain did), to having bespoke outfits made, to cycling and bamboo boat riding in Hoi An or sand surfing in Mui Ne...all throughout this amazing experience, our team leader Edna was incredibly supportive, inclusive and really the instigator of so much fun!

They truly cared our services day by day and made us comfortable. This trip was amazing from the start to the end. Halong and Ba Vi were outstanding than the others.

Right from the very start of my booking all the way through to our last transfer back to the airport to return home, I was dealt with by the very helpful Dat. He helped us with all communications and made everything very stress free so we could just enjoy all the trips without the hassle of organising ourselves (apart from being in the hotel foyer at the right time to be picked up!)\nThe trips we did were amazing and gave us a great insight into Vietnam over the short 10 day trip we did from The North to the South. Our 3* hotel accommodations throughout were to a very good standard, plus the meals etc included. Our excursions were not more than 15 people each time and we met some fantastic other holidaymakers on them. The guides we had on each tour were exceptional, very good English speaking and a great knowledge of their Vietnamese history, surrounding areas and the actual trip itself.\nOur favourite excursion being the Bavi Eco tour to the Ri Village to meet with locals at their own houses, to have lunch, cookery classes, a bike ride, boat tour and meeting with an ex Vietnamese Army soldier & his wife on their tea plantation to help them pick tea and take part in the drying process. This was an amazing day and quite humbling too!\nWe will definitely be returning to Vietnam, and I would have no hesitation in using this tour operator again.\nThanks again Dat and sorry we did not manage to meet up face to face as we had tried to.\nMany Thanks\nCara & Mike."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Amazing trip!

I didn’t enjoy the Ijen experience. I did not know what to expect and it was my worst experience of being frozen due to inadequate clothing( something the tourists need to be warned about) and also the exaggeration of the blue light. It was nothing like the photos and quite a dangerous expedition to walk up and then down into the crater in the dark. Again advice should be given to carry torches for people who are keen to go. I did take the chair which cost me quite a lot but well deserved by the people who took me up but a complete waste of time and money. The Jiwa Jawa hotel in Mount Bromo unfortunately was not the greatest. The bathroom was tiny and I could barely squeeze in (I am only a size 12 London size) so you can imagine the discomfort for someone larger. The bathroom had a bad smell and the room was very basic. The surroundings were nice and facilities adequate I would re think about accommodation in that hotel unless there are better rooms. Every thing else about the trip was great and thoroughly enjoyed.

I enjoyed his talks about Vietnam history, culture, and people. He was always so helpful. I felt like he was taking very good care of us throughout the entire trip. I can't say enough about Kien! As for the itinerary, there were two days of travel that I found tiring. One was the overnight train sleeper train ride to Hue. It's not easy for me to sleep on a train with three other people in the same berth. Still, I am glad I tried it as now I can say that I've done it. Plus, the people in my cabin were lovely and nice. There was one day when we had to wake up at 330 am to catch a plane to Ho Chi Minh City. The trip notes referred to this as \"an early morning flight to Ho Chi Minh City.\" I guess it didn't sink in just how tiring that day would be. After the flight, we took a three hour bus ride to the Mekong Delta. If you add up the time spent waiting in the airport and the time sitting on the plane, I think we must have sat for at least 8 hours that day. I am normally a very active person and one thing I found difficult about this tour was getting enough exercise. I felt like we sat a lot of the time, e.g. on a tour bus, at the restaurants, on boats, on a plane, on the train, etc. Having said all this, I don't know how I could have seen all the things that I was able to see in 10 days. I really felt like I saw Vietnam on this trip. And I also felt that the tour was well organized, all except for the first and last hotel. We weren't told which hotel we would stay at in Ho Chi Minh so I could not book my hotel for the next day (we stayed an extra day) with knowledge of where we would be moving from. I also did not know the first hotel until much closer to the tour date. By then, I had already booked a hotel in Hanoi in the centre of town. TOURRADAR will book additional nights stays before and after the tour in the tour hotel but I found the cost to be much higher than what I was able to find on BOOKING.COM. All in all, I give this tour a five star rating because I don't think much can be improved given the itinerary. One additional comment - it was an unexpected joy to get a pair of pants tailored in Hoi An. I wish I had scoured magazines for pictures of clothes that I like in advance to have them ready when I arrived. I chose to get pants tailored only at the last minute and was pleased with the results. So inexpensive and the pants fit perfectly! It's best to order the clothes on the first day to have time to make adjustments if adjustments are needed."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Guides were great.

After the flight, we took a three hour bus ride to the Mekong Delta. If you add up the time spent waiting in the airport and the time sitting on the plane, I think we must have sat for at least 8 hours that day. I am normally a very active person and one thing I found difficult about this tour was getting enough exercise. I felt like we sat a lot of the time, e.g. on a tour bus, at the restaurants, on boats, on a plane, on the train, etc. Having said all this, I don't know how I could have seen all the things that I was able to see in 10 days. I really felt like I saw Vietnam on this trip. And I also felt that the tour was well organized, all except for the first and last hotel. We weren't told which hotel we would stay at in Ho Chi Minh so I could not book my hotel for the next day (we stayed an extra day) with knowledge of where we would be moving from. I also did not know the first hotel until much closer to the tour date. By then, I had already booked a hotel in Hanoi in the centre of town. TOURRADAR will book additional nights stays before and after the tour in the tour hotel but I found the cost to be much higher than what I was able to find on BOOKING.COM. All in all, I give this tour a five star rating because I don't think much can be improved given the itinerary. One additional comment - it was an unexpected joy to get a pair of pants tailored in Hoi An. I wish I had scoured magazines for pictures of clothes that I like in advance to have them ready when I arrived. I chose to get pants tailored only at the last minute and was pleased with the results. So inexpensive and the pants fit perfectly! It's best to order the clothes on the first day to have time to make adjustments if adjustments are needed."},{"rating":"3.5","review":"Guides were great.

The hotels are good or very good. The coaches were good. Food was good with non spicy options for the less adventurous in the group. Vietnam and Cambodia, especially, have lots of litter, motorbikes and smelly bits along with magnificent tourist attractions.

The  route was interesting, the cycling was challenging enough to remain  enjoyable and our guide and support crew went out of their way to make it the best experience for us. I loved every part of Cycling Vietnam and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to experience authentic Vietnam.   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Each day had a highlight for me! The 30km downhill was a real buzz, visiting the Buddhist monestry and orphanage was heart renching, the fabulous fresh fruit, drinks and sweets prepared by the crew for our morning and afternoon breaks, the delightful children along our route and the wonderful overnight boat trip in Ha Long Bay would be up there with especially memorable moments.   What did you think of your group leader?  Tho Nugyen was such a nice person with a wonderful sense of humour, and his passion and respect for his country was contagious. As the group leader Tho set the tone for the group and he was a joy to be around. He looked out for each member of the &#xC2;&#xA0;group and tried to ensure that each person achieved what they wanted from their holiday. Tho went out of his way to smooth arrangements impacted by the typhoon and we felt that Tho went the extra effort to resolve any issues &#xC2;&#xA0;that arose- he was often seen with 3 phones on the go at once!!. &#xC2;&#xA0;I loved especially how Tho would present us with the problem and 2 - 3 ways to resolve it. He was a real gem, knowledgeable, informative and thoughtful and his goal was to make this trip a memorable experience for us - and indeed it was.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  You should be cycling fit to obtain the maximum benefit and enjoyment from the trip. All up we cycled around 550 kms ranging each day from between 30 kms to around 107km- and there was some undulating ( read &amp;quot;hilly') passages along they way with temperatures reaching the 30s on occasions. While the bus and support crew are there to help and you can leap onto the bus when your legs have had enough, the best sightseeing and interaction with locals comes when you are on your bike.   Is there anything else you would like to add?  This is the only guided tour i have done and the 'Cycling Vietnam' trip exceeded my expectations.

The climb was challenging but not impossible. I was amazed at how much fitness I gained whilst on holiday. Since it was the last major day of cycling, I decided to ride as quickly as I could for the last 30km and was amazed that I continued to feel great as I pushed myself well beyond what I would have been capable of just a few weeks earlier. It was so nice to relax in the hotel pool after such a day.   What did you think of your group leader?  The leader was friendly and helpful. He had some great insights into Vietnamese culture and history.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  I was the only person on my trip with my own bike (a touring bike). Whilst it was lovely to be on my own wheels, I think it was more trouble than it was worth. After buying a new suit in Hoi An, I ended up paying about US$200 in excess baggage so there was no real cost savings.   Is there anything else you would like to add?  Cycling is a wonderful way to see Vietnam. It is quite a densely populated country so even though we were in the country, most of the time there were plenty of houses around and there were no shortage of children shouting &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; or wanting high-fives as we went past.It was fantastic to be driven to the best places to ride. I expected more potholes and gravel road but often the roads were of about the same standard as my local area (Melbourne, Australia). Having said this, I would not want to ride a racing road bike on this trip. I have a pretty solid tourer and that was perfect.&#xC2;&#xA0;This sort of trip could be done without a touring company like Exodus but it wouldn't be half as enjoyable. Being ferried to the right places to ride, regular drink stops with lemon drink and tropical fruits being served as well as having all the accomodation hassles removed is worth every cent of the cost of the tour.This was my first Exodus trip but many other travellers had done several. I can see why. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a holiday and come back in better shape than when they left.&#xC2;&#xA0;&amp;nbsp;"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"My husband and I have just returned home from our cycling trip and we can't wait to plan our next tour! Our holiday far exceeded our expectations. We had a great group, so ably led by Linh our tour guide. We were a little worried that we wouldn't be able to cope with the heat and humidity on the trip as we are both in our 50's but the backup we received from Linh, Y and the bus and truck drivers was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Their support and consideration made the experience an unforgettable one for us. We loved Vietnam - the food, people and country side. Well done Exodus on an exceptionally well organised tour. We have travelled with other tour organisers before, but from now on it will be Exodus all the way.    What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  We loved the diversity of the tour. The challenge of cycling through little towns, the different resturants we ate in, the cooking class and the shopping experiences along the way. The children calling &amp;quot;hallo&amp;quot; as we passed was good fun but the stand out was the cruise on Halong Bay. It was a beautiful, relaxing way to end the trip.

It is great having a local guide. It really made the experience!   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?

I know many people who have been to Vietnam and they have all come back with glowing reviews and this trip did not let me down at all. I can honestly say that I enjoyed every single day and was amazed with how beautiful and old fashioned the country. Honestly, this is the best way to see a country as you really do take in sights, sounds and smells of it (plus a bit of mud, grit and diesel fumes). It will take a lot to top this trip.   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Cycling to Dalat and up the Hai Van Pass were personal highlights as the scenery was so beautiful I did not dare stop when the going got tough as I wanted to savour the sights rather than zip through them on the bus. I can honestly say that around every corner and over the top of every hill was a sight worth seeing and savouring. One turn it might be a peaceful river scene with a little boat gently putt putting its way around, the next you might see a load of water buffalo snouts poking through the water right the way through to beautiful rainforests, the most stunning beaches and ocean views I can say I have seen anywhere in the world...to date.   What did you think of your group leader?  Danh was great fun and had a good blend of knowledge and humour all throughout the trip. Cocktails on the sleeper train, cramming all 19 of us into a 4 man cabin on the sleeper train and the &amp;quot;penguins&amp;quot; are all good examples of his sense of humour. Always made sure that the pace of the trip was suitable for all members and gave good guidance as to what was coming up in terms of the following day and what we needed to do, where we needed to be and by when.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Do train for the trip as elements of it are tough. If you are relatively fit and take your time in the granny gears you can climb anything.  Read up on Vietnam as there is a lot of history that you will be ignorant to.  Whatever you plan on packing, I would say halve it and then take a few less items. You will only need 2-3 set of cycling clothing and the same for the evening. As Ryan said in the review before this one, you can buy anything else very cheaply when you are out there.  Take a mixture of Vietnamese Dong and US Dollars as both are useful to possess. You can change money in the hotels are decent rates without commission being charged as well.&#xC2;&#xA0;  &#xC2;&#xA0;   Is there anything else you would like to add?

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  The inspiration came from the people,and especially the kids who greeted us so enthusiastically.The people were friendly and welcoming,and placid-despite the overwhelming number of mopeds on the roads I never once encountered road rage !The scenery at times was spectacular,and the hotels were generally better than expected.   What did you think of your group leader?  Chi was superb,and hugely popular with the group. He was everything an excellent guide should be-knowledgeable,helpful,courteous,good sense of humour,always in complete control in a very relaxed way.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  I am not a serious cyclist-I am used to short rides of 2 hours or less-and I had no trouble with the cycling apart from the Mai Van Pass where I struggled,but made it ( I am in my sixties !&#xC2;&#xA0;).I did experience though saddle soreness at times,as did many others , so a gel cover is essential. Perhaps also a chamois cream.We were extremely well looked after at rest stops with refreshments-no need to take your own with you.Take care with the downhills,and with potholed roads - we had 2 accidents,neither fortunately too serious,but serious enough to stop any further cycling for the 2 individuals for the rest of the trip.   Is there anything else you would like to add?  I cannot recommend this trip highly enough-if you are considering but are not sure,do it-and do it before too long before tourism takes a big hold as it&#xC2;&#xA0;most certainly will in the next few years."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Everything I’ve come to expect from Exodus.  Excellent organisation, great hotels, fabulous food and the best guide yet.  If you do this trip…..you want Chi as your leader!

The 30k downhill was superb and surprisingly riding through the tail end of a monsoon&#xC2;&#xA0;gave a real energy boost.&#xC2;&#xA0;&#xC2;&#xA0; The freshness after 3 days of humidity was wonderful.   What did you think of your group leader?  Chi organised the trip impeccably.&#xC2;&#xA0;&#xC2;&#xA0; He was fabulous and both him and his aides Nang, Can&#xC2;&#xA0;and Lee&#xC2;&#xA0;worked tirelessly to make the trip memorable and fun. &#xC2;&#xA0;&#xC2;&#xA0;This was my 8th trip and Chi was easily the best guide I&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;ve had.

First Exodus trip, now planning our second   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Seeing all the children on the side of the road as we cycled through the remote villages.Cycling downhill 30km and on another day cycling up 10kmThe Vietnamese people are a happy nation.Great crew who looked after us   What did you think of your group leader?  Chi and his 3 helpers were excellent. Chi's knowledge of his country was immense and he had a great sense of humour. Really well organised although I did think we could have got going quicker after some stops.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  We didn't have any problems with mosquitos.The overnight rail journey wasn't great - a lot of tired people next day.Our baggage didn't arrive on our plane but about 8 hours later. Consider putting any important cycling kit in hand luggage.Generally it is very cheap to eat and drink. If I went again I would take mainly Dong rather than Dollars.Waiting 6 hours at Kuala Lumpar on return wasn't fun especially as some in group caught a later flight with a much shorter wait.We had two crashes which kept the injured parties off the road for a couple of days - it is safe but you need to be careful   Is there anything else you would like to add?  Our fellow travellers contributed to a great holiday. The slower cyclists were very considerate and minimised any waiting around by getting started quickly after a stop.Chi organised some great group dinners in the evening.Night in Halong Bay exceeded our expectations.Hotels were generally of a good standard"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This trip exceeded my expectations of the adventure I had signed up for. Vietnam is a beautiful country and there is no better way to get a real feel for the culture and 'real Vietnam' than to cycle through it. The cycling itself was great, I would say at the high end of moderate on some days, but the bus is always there for people who do not want to climb the hills.   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Probably the children in the small villages and towns who wave, shout out hello and try and give you a 'high five' as you cycle past. These children are obviously poor, but they are so happy that it teaches us something about out material way of life.&#xC2;&#xA0;The ever changing scenery from coastal, to mountain and frm small villages to bustling cities is the other main memory of the trip, and Halong Bay is just fantastic!   What did you think of your group leader?  Tho was a great Group Leader, and let's not forget the support team (2 drivers plus the mechanic). As a team they worked very well indeed and we were shown places that 'normal' tourists would not see, ate in small house restuarants and generally avioded most of the tourist traps. Tho worked tirelessly and was knowlwdgable about the culture and history of Vietnam, always willing to talk about anything. Organisation was great: Turn up when you are asked to and that is all you have to worry about. Working as a team on the ride you should never get lost, but can ride at your own pace.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Bring good quality padded cycling shorts (at least 2 pairs) and some 'bun cream'! Most people wear loose shorts over the top of the lycra ones. The only people who suffered were those who were saddle sore.Don't rush the rides through the most senic areas, stop, take photos, soak in the atmosphere!! Most of our group did.&#xC2;&#xA0;&amp;nbsp;   Is there anything else you would like to add?  If you are looking for a bit of an adventure that is not too grueling, with good oriental food and some sightseeing in between the cycling then this is a great trip. Our Group Leader said that every day would be another best day.. and he wasn't often wrong!!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"A tough experience but thoroughly rewarding when you completed your day of cycling.   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?

What did you think of your group leader?  Tom was brilliant!&#xC2;&#xA0; He couldnt help people enough and had so much knowledge.&#xC2;&#xA0;His quote summarised the trip - 'Everyday is another best day'   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Make sure you practice riding even if you are reasonably fit.&#xC2;&#xA0; I thought I was quite fit as I play netball and do bootcamps and am quite active but nothing prepared me for those long days on the bike and especially the hills!&#xC2;&#xA0; Make sure you take lots of padding for your backside!

The Vietnamese people were very friendly - even getting invited to sing at a wedding which we declined - and the food was great. Hotels were in the main pretty good and the boat around Halong Bay far better than expected. Organisation of the tour first class and couldn't be faulted.   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  The 30Km decent down the mountain from Delat and achieving 103.1 KM that daySwimming in the surf in the South China sea in Mui Ne as the sun setThe fishing village at Ngn Trang where very few tourists go. Also passing through the villages off the beaten track.Hoi An lit up at night, the rice cakes being crisped up and the hand made shoes being madeThe Mausoleum to Tu Doc in Hue and the Citadel.&#xC2;&#xA0;Learning about the history of Vietnam and something of the culture.&#xC2;&#xA0;The lagoon at Halong Bay.Local Markets &#xC2;&#xA0;The reviving lemon drink! &amp;nbsp;   What did you think of your group leader?  Danh was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble to sort out. He was friendly and knowledgeable. The organisation of the tour went like clockwork. I can't praise him highly enough.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  It&#xC2;&#xA0; is worth seeeing this tour as a tour of Vietnam with some cycling, although some days are quite hard. I think we had 3 days over 80km which is quite hard on a mountain bike with pretty thick tyres. I took clip-on pedals and cycling shoes - which certainly helped me although only 2 us did in a party of 19.There are quite a few long session on the coach but this is more than main up by seeing the main cultural highlights of the country. There are stops every 20km but it is really too hot to wear a back pack (although some did). I brought a small carrier that can fit on the back of the bike a take a compact camera, my glasses and an energy bar which I found useful. A couple of 'wicking' tops were good.   Is there anything else you would like to add?  &#xC2;&#xA0;Would have like more time to explore Hanoi The tour of the Citadel in Hue was rather rushed but understand this not everyone wants to spend time looking at ruins!&#xC2;&#xA0;"}]},{"name":"Vietnam Highlight with 12 Days 11 Nights","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"A very well organized tour with a great and helpful team.

She knew her stuff and history about the country after being there for over 6 years. She knew a lot of people and is well liked by the locals which helps and says it all.\n\nVery personable and goes the extra mile to help you with information, onward travel, research etc etc.\n\nShe is very relaxed and for the ‘free time’ or evenings she is open to suggestions if the group don’t want to do what’s planned. She also is happy if people want to do something different if they are set on doing something or seeing something specific outside of the tour. \n\nWould highly recommend, throughly enjoyed!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Amazing tour! With Laura we were learning everything about Vietnam. She explain everything what you like to know and she is so helpful and friendly. Even in time of Corona she knows what to do and where we can go to eat or to see something. She give all information to us immediately. The group is number one for Laura and she is also loved by the Vietnamese people. She helps also if you like to have a romantic evening alone or some special places. We learned some Vietnamese words and phrases of her and how we have to act in Vietnam. Can not believe how much we learned about this country and the people because of Laura!

As someone who has had Vietnam on the top of their ‘to visit list’ for many years I am so glad I did it this way. \nAside from the beauty that Vietnam has itself, Laura made this tour for me. I don’t think it would be possible to find a tour guide that genuinely loves Vietnam, or South East Asia in general, and it’s people more than her and they love her in return - she can’t walk down the street without someone coming up and hugging her. This comes through in all the detailed information she gives you about the country’s culture and history. When she talks, her passion for what she does comes through. She wants everyone else to love Vietnam as much as her and will bend over backwards to ensure you have the best experience you can. She doesn’t clock out when the tour finishes either. If you’re travelling afterwards in South East Asia she will give you recommendations on where to go/what to do/where to eat and will help you with onward plans as much as she can. \nThe itinerary that Ultimate have I believe is much better value for money than the others on offer so if you’re thinking about booking this tour, just do it you won’t regret it. \nVietnam oiiiii!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Deutsch [Original Text] :\nMeine Reise nach Vietnam im Oktober 2019, habe ich damals sehr spontan und ohne darüber nachzudenken an einem Abend gebucht, da ich vor meinem 30 Geburtstag einmal mit dem Rucksack und ohne Freundin \"alleine\" verreisen wollte. \nEs war meine erste Reise nach Asien, ich bin ohne große Erwartungen in mein kleines Abenteuer gestartet.\nIch habe nur gehofft, dass meine Mitreisenden und unser Tourguide einigermaßen gut drauf sind und ich gesund wieder nach Deutschland komme :-)\n\nDie Tour selber habe ich über backpackerpack.de gebucht und war mit dem Service und dem Ablauf der Buchung sehr zufrieden.

I chose the Ultimate Vietnam tour and did not know what to expect. The two weeks I spent in Vietnam felt like a month as a result of the detailed itinerary that was in store. The tour itself went beyond my expectations. Every day was a wonder to venture into! My favourite highlights were the party boat we were on, kayaking around Ha Long Bay and Hoi-An. Putting aside the itinerary I think what made this trip more enjoyable then it was meant to be was the small group I was with and most importantly my tour group leader LAURA. She is really friendly, has an amazing presence, easy to be yourself around and such a compassionate person.\nShe always recommended the best places to eat and visit!\nWhat is also very intriguing about her is her passion for the locals! \nIf your looking to do a vietnam trip she is the person to go to!!\nHighly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"The tour was a great experience for my first time in Vietnam especially for the cost of the trip.

I would say to improve this experience would be the transportation as I found it was alot of time travelling on lower end buses, therefore I would be willing to pay more to have better transportation like flights to experience more time in certain areas of the trip.

It was definitely worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone.

At the beginning, I was sceptical, as I travelled a lot on my own before. I chose this group backpacking tour, because I only had two weeks and wanted to get a good overview of Vietnam. Another reason was that i did not have the time to look up all the best places before and i wanted to try what its like to not lose time doing research. You guys know how often and how long it can take to find and organise the next destination. Further, I usually get bored after a while of travelling on my own and all of the same smalltalk that comes along. I liked the idea of a group for two weeks. Which turned out to be the perfect fit.\nI really enjoyed it, that someone organised that. Its a relaxed and comfortable way and everthing worked perfect. Also when i would have done the research on my own, i would never get to the places or activities Laura took us. Besides her very good knowledge of the country, people, their history, language and best places, Laura is smart, tolerant, friendly and funny ;)\nLaura is not only a guide, she became a friend.

Christine couldn't have done more for us as a group and as individuals. She was happy to change things to accommodate around specific needs, made sure we were comfortable, gave us tips and advice for the different areas plus she was such a fun person to experience a new country with and I also felt really safe. We instantly made friends with our whole group which made it even more enjoyable. The itinerary had such a range of activities and everyone agreed it was really balanced. We went on amazing nights out, food tours, visits to landmarks/historical sites, a stay on a private island, a boat party, canyoning, chilled beach/pool days and still managed lots of time to do some shopping and relax. We fit so much in that it felt like we'd all been there months. I would suggest bringing a light microfibre towel as a backup option just because a few hostels weren't always able to provide one or charged a lot to replace a lost towel and so it made it a bit inconsistent for a few people. Secondly, don't misjudge how cost-effective Vietnam is! We had to cover the cost of every evening meal plus quite a few lunches, and although all of the food/restaurants were incredible and totally worth it, it quickly added up and all of us had to get more cash out as the weeks went on (which was easy to do but worth knowing about beforehand). I'd highly recommend the tour to anyone who wants to experience a lot of Vietnam in one trip and I'd do it all again in a heartbeat.

You're amazing!"},{"rating":"3.0","review":"As a young female, I look to join a group tour for a few reasons including a pre-set itinerary, safety, and to gain a more enriched cultural experience. I have a very busy schedule and a prearranged tour eliminates a lot of the extra stress and time needed to plan a trip that I simply cannot put forth. I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed with my experience with the Ultimate Vietnam tour. I paid such a large sum of money for the tour plus the additional travel expenses only to be left with a disorganized, below average travel experience that failed to meet my expectations.\n\nAs a guide, it is expected that you communicate to the group the activities and itinerary for the trip to the entire group. A lot of issues stemmed from the guide’s failure to perform her duties. The group was constantly left in the dark as there was very little communication or organization. Instead of actually performing her job, she spent the entire two weeks partying and drinking obscene amounts. She was always the most drunk person every single night, which meant if anyone from the group actually needed help they were left to figure it out themselves. This was completely irresponsibly behavior and did not create for a safe atmosphere. There were times when girls would be too drunk and get lost on the way home because the tour guide was too busy partying and picking up guys to answer messages or notice that someone was struggling. On multiple occasions, our guide would become so intoxicated that she would black-out or have seizures in the bar. The girls from the tour group ended up becoming responsible for getting the guide home safely instead of the other way around. In my opinion, this is completely unacceptable. \n\nThis entire trip turned out to be a party every night and hangover recovery every day. Our guide could not be reached during the day as she was sick, sleeping, or recovering from nights out. For the remaining members of the group that were hoping to explore each destination during the day, we were left to figure an itinerary and local activities for ourselves. \n\nI was so disappointed with this as I joined a tour to explore a new country and hope to gain an enriched cultural experience. If I wanted to party every day, I would have never left home. Those who did not participate in the “nightly festivities” were essentially looked down upon. I am perfectly happy to have few nights out, however, every single day was complete overkill and took away from my experience in Vietnam. \n\n\nIn regards to the arrangement of the tour, I felt the company did a very poor job of communicating the itinerary. The company failed to disclose the amount of travel that was actually required during the day. On the documents provided, Ultimate discloses information regarding a night bus trip to get from Hoi An to Ninh Van Bay, but does not mention that just about every other day is spent on public buses moving to the next location. \nDay 3: 4 hour bus to Halong bay\nDay 5: full day of waiting around to get back to the mainland to take the 4 hour bus ride back to Hanoi, only to leave for the airport the next morning for another travel day\nDay 6: Hanoi to Hoi An –  Late flight  another full travel day\nDay 8: 8 hour night bus from hoi an to Nin Vanh bay\nDay 10: 7.5 hour bus to Da Lat\nDay 12: 7 hour bus to Ho chi minh\nI understand that travel is necessary to reach all the destinations, however, we wasted so many days on a bus as we would not reach the destination until the evening and would not be able to explore any part of the new location. If I had been aware of the uncomfortable travel situations, I would not have booked this tour and would have made arrangements myself. The public bus transportation was incredibly uncomfortable and left half of the group upset with the organization of the tour as they were unaware of the number of full day bus travel throughout the trip. For the final bus trip from Da Lat to Ho Chi Minh, half of the group went out on their own to book a flight as it was very inexpensive and allowed us to actually spend time in a new destination. I think this goes to show that there was poor organization and communication with this trip as people were fed up and decided to make their own more efficient and comfortable travel arrangements."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"I totally recommend this tour! You get to see a lot in a short time without feeling rushed. Good balance of culture, nature and party! Most of the accommodations are good, woody house in Dalat had [comment removed in moderation] bathrooms and loud neighbors though! Special thanks to our guide Christine, she took such good care of us, made sure everyone was having a good time and was always down to whatever we wanted to do. In our free time she always had a lot of recommendations what to do and also had a lot of background knowledge about the culture, history and people of Vietnam!"},{"rating":"3.0","review":"Although Vietnam is a beautiful country and I certainly saw and did some incredible things while I was there, I have to say that, overall, I am disappointed with this tour. In regards to the itinerary, I felt that it was a waste of a day to travel back to Hanoi after the Halong Bay trip, and that that there was a little bit too much travel so close together at the end of the trip, especially when we were not even told about the one 7.5 hour drive to get to Da Lat...until we were 2 hours into the drive. I also felt that some days were a waste since activities did not start until later on, or that sometimes the activity for the day was to \"go to the market\" which is not really an activity, and is more something that you could do in your free time. \n\nI felt that our guide was not very knowledgeable about the country itself. She seemed to know a lot about the hot bar spots, and some basic facts about each city and some about the war, but I don't really feel as though I learned much about Vietnam from her, as I have from tour guides I have had in the past. This whole trip was actually booked by \"Buffalo tours\" and so often our guide didn't always seem like she was in control of our itinerary and in one new leg of the trip, she was very disorganized and wasn't actually prepared to get us off the night bus and into our next transportation van. Group members had to wake her up, and chat with the new transportation van to ensure that it was in fact the correct one. In regards to the same leg, she had told us that we would have a 4 hour drive, which turned out to be a 7.5 hours drive. Since this leg was not new to the company, and only new to our guide, this was in fact a huge oversight on her behalf. In another instance, our group encountered some very drunk travellers on a bus. Our group was very annoyed, especially when it became apparent to us that one of the travellers had peed on the bus, and it was trickling down the bus onto people's bags. Our guide kept saying she couldn't say anything to them, because they weren't part of the group. One of her group members actually stood up for the whole group and asked them to be quiet and got them to apologize to the girl who now had a urine soaked bag. Our guide's response? It wasn't a big deal, and it was better join to laugh with them rather than call them out.\n\nOften, when we would travel our guide would separate herself from the group, sit at the back of the bus and go to sleep. She would not make attempts to connect the group together, or get to know her group during these travel times. On times when the group was split into two vehicles, she would share information with one group, and then forget to let the other group in on the information she had shared with the other. She only let us know what was going on the night before it was happening, and if you asked for more information ahead of time, she sort of made you feel like you were being annoying for asking. \n\nIf you are looking for a party tour, then this may be the tour for you. I feel as though our group was a little split on \"party-ers\" vs more of a social drinking crew. Our guide really did connect with the party-ers, and if this is your jam, you will likely love this tour. However, I feel that at times her partying was unprofessional as it started to impact our tour. For instance, she would sometimes skip activities, or alter our activities in the mornings because she was hungover, or was getting \"sick\" because her severe lack of sleep due to partying. This happened on 3 occasions. She was often the most intoxicated person in the group, and at times group members had messaged her for help to get home, and she did not respond to them until the morning. In one instance, her group members had to escort her home to the hotel. She also implied that Ultimate travel expected her to go out and party every night. However, on one instance, she planned to go out and party on her own, without the group, after cutting a group activity short because she had \"errands\" to run.\n\nOverall, my experience with this tour company was poor, and I will not be choosing to travel with them again. I have had many other incredible trips and experiences with other tour companies that I have found on tour radar, but this company was not one of them."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Best tour guide EVERRRR! \n\nLaura’s passion and knowledge of Vietnamese culture made for great listening (as well as her many hilarious anecdotes from living in SE Asia)!

The company went to great lengths to sort out a few small issues we had. We appreciated this. However, they need to warn you when you book for a January trip about the Tet (lunar new year) disruption. We knew nothing about it. Several places were shut, a trip had to be changed which we weren't told about until the night before......and even the flat tyre on the bus couldn't be mended because of Tet. And personally, although the communication was good with our rep, we had to initiate all contact, asking for pick up times for the following day. They should be sent 24 hours before so we could plan our free time around tour arrangements. We had to pester our tour rep the day before constantly. Then he was very good at sorting things. Everything seemed very last minute. Even though we had sent our return flight details 2 weeks before, our rep asked for them again the day before our return flight .  Even though we booked the tour 6 months before, our rep booked the internal flights 2 weeks before.....so availability ( because of Tet AGAIN!!) WAS poor. I imagine they therefore  ended up paying more for the flights because they booked them so late ...just disorganised. (And we had a midnight flight!)\n2 of our hotels were disappointing. We were moved from one to a fabulous one....thank you. HCMC hotel was poor and breakfast staff rude - current pricing was about £25 a night so not surprising! For £35 a night they could have booked a much nicer hotel. At all other hotels staff were fabulous.\nThe last minute organisation was frustrating, but the Bavi eco trip from Hanoi was amazing, car transfers excellent, and the company boss phoned us and was very conciliatory."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Mekong was so good.

When I got there I was told there was no group and I met a different guide everywhere I went. This was not bad in itself (except for when I had to rely on a bus driver sending me to a shop, sending me to another shop and wandering around looking for someone I had no contact details for to give me my train ticket), but I would  have managed my expectations had I been warned. \n\nI was disappointed by the Sapa leg of the trip. My hotel, the Bamboo Sapa was still under construction. The sound of drilling was deafening, they were even drilling in the breakfast room as we ate. My room was still covered in dust from the construction. I spoke to other tourists who said they had been moved out of the hotel because it was not ready yet, I think I should not have been put there either. \n\nI also think that there should have been an alternative offered for the trekkking in Sapa or it should have been cancelled in the heavy rain. To me it was far too dangerous trying to get down the mountain in torrrential rain and very slippery mud. I fell many times as it was almost impossible to get down the hillside and it was impossible to enjoy the rest of the day when soaked to the skin and covered in mud. Given a choice I would have preferred to miss the activity as the day was miserable. \n\nThe rest of the trip was fine and well organised, and Tony did a great job of arranging in Hanoi. As I said, I think that it should be made clear that this is a self-guided trip and not really a tour at all, then other travellers might not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2.5","review":"This trip was so poorly organized, it was almost a joke. If you have any sense to book your own train tickets/day excursions, I would never go through tour company again. Book your tickets yourself. One of the biggest surprises was that this isn't really a \"tour\" where they load you in a bus with a bunch of people and you're traveling with them through your trip. Instead, what they do is coordinate the trip/plan your train tickets, get tickets onto the cruise or with another tour group for a day excursion. It was very poorly organized. We landed at 11am after 25 hours of travel... and had nothing planned or recommendations to go see. We ended up sitting in a hotel lobby until 8pm, until we could go to train station for  night train. We were so tired, and there was nowhere to freshen up or take a quick nap. Second big disappointment came on Day 3 which is market day. On Sundays, you get to go to a big market that takes hours to go through. But any other day of the week you just go to any market that's open. We were driven 2 hours out of Sapa for a market, were there for 15 minutes, and then got back into the car and taken to a train station, which we had tickets for a night train that left at 10pm. It was hell. The town was super boring/not much to walk around and see, nowhere to check-in and relax. We literally sat at a cafe and read for 8 hours. The ONLY thing we enjoyed about this trip were the day excursions Trekking through Sapa and Halong Bay Cruise... both of which were not run by this tour company and instead were day trips they helped set up. I can not emphasize enough that if I did it again, I would never go through tour company. Set up the tickets and excursions yourself."},{"rating":"3.5","review":"Highs and lows, some parts were excellent (halong bay stretch) and some parts were not so great (aspects of the sapa trip). Worth reiterating some of the other reviews...this is not group travel, rather lots of bits of trips strung together, but for me that was enough as a solo traveller. There was enough free time that you didn't feel like a lemon seeing just the tourist trail. Seemed to be a big difference between 3* and 4*, so if you can plug for it, it's worth it as 3* here is not equiveleant to a 3* in Europe. Overall pretty positive though.

Phnom Penh - great stay, great eating, fun traffic experiences. Sihanoukville - less than wonderful resort. Personnel fine, pool small, open bathroom a bit disconcerting - accessible to mosquitoes, wildlife etc (although we didn't experience any 'visits'). Nearby beach - although clean water - was not very visually pleasing.

Â He will make the trip for many who travel with him. Â Key phrase; 'are we feeling heavy?' - which you could take to mean;1. Do we need an exceptionally strong local coffee?orÂ 2.

This was a wonderful trip for experiencing the landscapes, people, culture, towns and villages of Vietnam with the help of a well informed local guide. It was a great introduction which has whetted our appetite to go back and explore further!   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?The whole holiday was full of amazing experiences so itâ&#x80;&#x99;s difficult to single out one momentÂ  but here are a few of our favourites:Â  Kayaking in Halong Bay â&#x80;&#x93; enjoying the tranquillity of this awesome limestone landscape The Old Quarter of Hanoi â&#x80;&#x93;the lively street life and managing to cross the road by ourselves Hoi An â&#x80;&#x93; the fun of the tailors, the lanterns at night, theÂ  bike rideâ&#x80;&#x93; the exhilaration of hearing the wind rising in the banana trees before the monsoon rain descended on us Dinner with local people â&#x80;&#x93; the courtesy of our hosts and the wonderful food (but not the betel nut chewing â&#x80;&#x93; beware!)The Citadel at Hue â&#x80;&#x93; the monksâ&#x80;&#x99; music resonating around the courtyard of this splendid buildingGroup team building at Brown Eyes, Hue!!War Remnants museum â&#x80;&#x93; because it brings home how recently Vietnam and her people have experienced devastation and makes their optimism and sense of fun all the more amazing The Mekong Delta trip â&#x80;&#x93; all of itWhat did you think of your group leader?Ha was terrific â&#x80;&#x93; very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his country. He seemed to intuitively know how much information we needed and when. We were a small group and therefore had the bonus of spending a lot of time with him. This was brilliant as he was great fun to be with â&#x80;&#x93; full of laughter and fun â&#x80;&#x93; which made for a very happy holiday. He gave us the opportunity to have a wide range of experiences and to better understand and appreciate Vietnam and its people. An excellent representative for Exodus!Do you have any advice for potential travellers?As others have mentioned do travel light . You donâ&#x80;&#x99;t need to take a lot of clothes as the laundry facilities at Hue or Ho Ann are cheap so you only really need to take a weekâ&#x80;&#x99;s clothes for a two week trip. Leave sufficient luggage space to bring home souvenirs. If possible have an idea of a garment youâ&#x80;&#x99;d like made at Hoi Ann â&#x80;&#x93; itâ&#x80;&#x99;s really worth it and great fun. Â Take up all the optional excursions on offerâ&#x80;&#x93; these provided some of our best experiences. Â Just go â&#x80;&#x93; go soon â&#x80;&#x93; and make the most of the experience!Is there anything else you would like to add?We went on the Angkor Wat extension. Whilst it was great to travel in Cambodia weâ&#x80;&#x99;d suggest that Â Exodus consider re-ordering the trip as the visit to the Killing Fields and Genocide Museum are at the end Â which means you leave on rather a sober note. We would have preferred to end with the positive experience of the temples at the Anghor complex."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This is an amazing trip from the North to the South of Vietnam. You manage to visit Cities, sail in Halong Bay, travel by overnight train and get to experience some wonderful countryside. It's hectic but there is time to rest and relax and enjoy the amazing sights. A fantastic trip.What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?Too many to single out one thing. The night on Halong Bay was lovely. Hoi An is an amazing place with its lovely buildings and river. Sailing through the Mekong delta canals being rowed by a little old lady. The peace and quiet of the homestay. Cycling in Hoi An was great. Too windy to go to the beach, but we had a fantastic cycle through the countryside, rice fields and seeing where all the local vegetables were grown. Followed by a barbeque on a quiet river bank - bliss.Cocktails on the 50th floor of the building with the helipad in Saigon.What did you think of your group leader?Thuy was great. He really looked after us and took us to many lovely restaurants. We were very fussy eaters which I think proved a bit of a challenge at first but Thuy managed to make sure we were well catered for. Very knowledgeable and kind - a great representative for Exodus.Do you have any advice for potential travellers?As others have said laundry is cheap and easy to get done. So travel light as there are so many beautiful clothes to buy or get made out there.Is there anything else you would like to add?My only problem was the fact that you don't fly directly to Vietnam but have to go to Kuala Lumper then on to Hanoi on the outward journey. It made the journey so much longer especially as we were delayed on both legs going out. However Malaysian Airlines are very good so maybe it's better to keep the quality. I love the fact that with Exodus you do so many different things on holiday. I feel that i've done so much it feels more like i've been away a month.

Â Should it be the Marble Mountain Pagoda? Â The homestay and preparing (or at least attempting to be of some help with our efforts) the evening meal, the war museum in HCM City, or the ready laughter and good humour of the Hanoi shop keeper as my wife attempted to haggle a bargain price? Â Or the Cu Chi Tunnels, Halong Bay, the overnight train from Hanoi to Hue, the ...? Â I can't choose.Â What did you think of your group leader?Absolutely excellent in every regard. Â He was instrumental in creating this memorable holiday and a large factor in so many of the warm memories we carry from it.Do you have any advice for potential travellers?Pack light. Â Buy any extra clothing you need when in the country. Â You'll be glad you left room in the case for your purchases. Â And don't be put off by accounts of the traffic and road-crossing experience. Â It's actually quite exhilerating.Is there anything else you would like to add?Exodus don't over-sell their holiday in their information sheets and notes.

The truth is the berths were filthy,you have to sit on the bottom  beds to eat , going down to the bar involves trying  to wade your way thru 10 carriages crammed with people in the walkways to a bar only able to take a few people- and the berths can never be left unattended so someone will always be left behind.. I am a traveller used to basic conditions but this was not a pleasant experience.&#xD;\nThere were several people who would also have chosen to spend extra to fly Hanoi to Hue and pay the extra involved.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nThe hotel in Hoian needs to get room safes sorted out - its a complete pain keep going to reception and having to recount your money in front of the public everytime you want to take money out of their safe."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Vietnam by wheelchair - interesting!! (But very do-able)Beautiful Country, wonderful food and very friendly and helpful people   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Vietnam is not what you expect - what did I expect...I don't know. It was very beautiful especially Hoi An, Saigon is gobsmacking and really takes you by suprise - more like New York than how I visualised Saigon. The best bit... going on a San Pan and staying at the home stay in the Meekong Delta, lovely... being part of a large family, cooking the dinner and relaxing in the open air on a very pretty veranda.   What did you think of your group leader?  Our group leader was excellent, yes we did have a couple of blips but we had some very strong personalities in our group, a partially sighted lady and my husband in a wheelchair... but we all came out unscathed and the tour guide really thought ahead, if we couldnt do it, he had already planned an alternative...&#xC2;&#xA0; that may have been a different route in or out of a place .e.g slope, lift etc instead of stairs or a different activity.. I went up into the caves my husband did Kyaking   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Lots and we have written a guide called' Travel tips for wheelchair users in Vietnam', which we have sent to Exodus. A few tips to think about...Walk in the road, go slow and dont rushOnly consider Vietnam if you have a little mobility - you will need to get in and out of your wheelchair as every where has a step or two, but once you are in - fairly flatLet people help you - they are only too willingBe flexibleBe prepared for half measures of disability awareness - lovely assessible toilet with grab rails - up 4 steps...Saigon you can use the pavements - they have ramps - but they are not parallel to each other you have to look for the next one - so you will go down a ramp go across the road and find you are facing a high pavement edgeIt can be hard at times but worth itMake the most of your free time to recharge your batteries   Is there anything else you would like to add?  If you are going to visit and are taking a wheelchair with you the two places that are no no's are My Son, all ruins and totally inassessible and the tour round the Meekong Delta Home stay Village, quite hairy by foot, impossible by wheelchair.You will not be disappointed with the Vietnamese people they were so friendly and helpful, even if you didnt ask they will see if you are okVietnam is easy to navigate and very safe to wander around on your own - great holiday...

I loved every day of this trip, but highlights included:Hanoi - the remains of Hoa Lo Prison (dubbed the &amp;quot;Hanoi Hilton&amp;quot;) and getting lost wandering the streets of&#xC2;&#xA0;the Old Quarter taking in the sights and sounds of everyday street lifeHalong Bay - sailing among the picturesque limestone peaks and the fantastic seafood on boardReunification Express - no trip&#xC2;&#xA0;would have been&#xC2;&#xA0;complete without riding on this train which unites North and SouthHue - dragon boat ride along the pefume river stopping to see the stunning mausoleum of Tu Duc, and to see the impressive Thien Mu Pagoda. The Imperial Citadel tour was also a highlight. An optional King and Queen night allowed you to dress up and dine with traditional music played whilst eating - completely tourist-driven, but memorable nonethelessHai Van Pass - stunning views to the oceanDanang - walking on China Beach and dipping a toe in the sea, and&#xC2;&#xA0;walking up the steps to Marble Mountain to see the impressive caves used as a hospital by the Viet&#xC2;&#xA0;Cong during the warHoi An - beautiful small town with historic buildings and oodles of charm.&#xC2;&#xA0;Apparently nicknamed the culinary capital&#xC2;&#xA0;with a buzzing&#xC2;&#xA0;riverside market. Each shop-front is also obliged to have lanterns hanging, which look beautiful come evenings.Ho Chi Minh City - vibrant metropolis with lots to see and do. I enjoyed sitting in the cafes watching the world go by, the crowds at the Ben Than Market, and Saigon Skydeck (Bitexco Tower) watching the city from the 49th floor. I particularly enjoyed the Reunification Palace whose architecture and interiors were pure 1970s kitsch, along with the basement's military command centre, still equipped with old rotary-dial phones and radio equipment. The War Remnants Museum had some&#xC2;&#xA0;haunting&#xC2;&#xA0;photographs. I would strongly advise taking a walk to the Old Post Office (designed by Monsieur Eiffel), Notre Dame Cathedral, and if you get chance wander to the Ho Chi Minh City Museum and Fine Art Museums which are housed in grand old colonial buildings. Although you can't enter the Hotel De Ville, it is certainly worth viewing from the exterior. The Municipality Building (Opera House) although only open for twice-monthly performances is also worth viewing from the outside. The Sri Thendayyutthapani Temple is also well-worth visiting with a very interesting rooftop tower.Try to make time to&#xC2;&#xA0;enjoy the rooftop garden at The  Rex Hotel, The Saigon-Saigon Rooftop Bar at The Caravelle Hotel, and Level 23 at The Sheraton Hotel, which all have great views.Cu Chi - tunnels are a must-see with interesting demonstrations of the traps the Viet Cong used to set, a shooting range and, although widened for Westerners, a very claustrophobic and humid short-section of tunnel to crawl throughMekong Delta - riding in a traditional wooden sampan and an enjoyable homestay   What did you think of your group leader?  Our group leader, Thuy, was excellent. He was very knowledgeable and approachable. He was also passionate about Vietnam, it's history and people. Most importantly his English language was excellent and he had a great sense of humour.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Although this trip is marked as Moderate, I have been on Exodus trips labelled as Leisurely which have been more exertional, so fear not.There is a great balance of sight-seeing and free-time. I booked this trip for January as although I knew the weather may not be perfect in the North - Hanoi and Halong Bay - (10-15 degrees C with some drizzle and clouds), I was aware that in the South it would be warm (30 degrees plus). Rainy season in the South is from April, although I hear it only rains for short bursts each day, but is incredibly humid.Internet availability was excellent throughout Vietnam and wifi is freely available in all the hotels.Take a bunch of $1 bills for buying mementos, and try and get smaller notes of Dong prior to going to Vietnam - 50,000, 100,000 and 200,000 should be fine. The ATM will only let you withdraw &#xC2;&#xA3;60 at a time, although this does equate to 2,000,000 Dong. Aside from Ho Chi Minh City - you can eat and drink well for very little.You don't need walking boots for Marble Mountain   Is there anything else you would like to add?  I took along 'The Rough Guide to Vietnam' which was an invaluable&#xC2;&#xA0;aid to&#xC2;&#xA0;my free time and enabled me to do plenty more sight-seeing in addition to the itinerary.Great trip. Can't recommend it enough. Book it. ;-)"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"  Wow, what a country to visit - Go before it all changes!  This trip was well structured and everyday brought a new experience; Hanoi is a 100% culture shock with its own sound track - the horns of a million mopeds, Halong Bay was a cool break from the city, the train south was memorable - just don't order room service!  Hue and Hoi An were full of new sights, sounds and tastes, Ho Chi Min City was crazy and chaotic and the Mekong homestay was a tranquil respite to end the trip.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Treat the Vietnamese with respect and they will welcome you with a smile. Go with the flow.&#xC2;&#xA0; Don't expect western standards everywhere, although you'll be surprised by how the arrangements all work seamlessly.&#xC2;&#xA0;   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  My highlights:   Halong Bay overnight - No sign of 007, but what a memorable location.  Mekong homestay - Sipping a cold beer in a hammock on the veranda, looking forward to a delicious dinner of fish and seafood. Yummy!   Hue - cycling into the country and watching the duck farmers shepherding their flock down the canal.   Hoi An - bartering for two new handmade shirts in one of the many tailors.   What did you think of your group leader?  Hai was a great trip leader; always ready to help and to ensure we were enjoying the trip.&#xC2;&#xA0; Our safety came first - it's been a while since I was helped across the road!&#xC2;&#xA0;Beware his sense of humour."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This trip converted me from backpacking to organized tours, as a way of relaxing and getting to know a place. It was very well organized and covered interesting ground, at just the right pace. But far and away the best thing was our Vietnamese guide, Anh Nguyen, a consummate professional. He was unfailingly attentive and generous with interesting information, even about himself.    What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Favourite tours were the tunnels, watching food being made in the Mekong Delta, home stay in the MeKong Delta, Marble Mountain's astonishing natural 'cathedral' and the magnificent giant Buddha hiding around the corner in a secluded magical sunbathed grotto. &#xD;\n&#xD;\nMost inspirational were the wonderful scenes of Vietnamese people going about their business, giving us lip in the markets, and dealing with traffic. The winner on that score was the woman crossing the street in HCM City while about 15 motorbikes, cars, trucks and buses moved abreast in a wave toward her, while she carefully counted a wad of cash, a tiny baby sleeping on her shoulder, not even glancing at the traffic, instead letting it weave its way around her. SO Vietnam.&#xD;\n&#xD;\nAnother favorite moment was when Anh performed a song in the middle of a field, inspired by a flower there.   What did you think of your group leader?  See above. Wonderful.   Is there anything else you would like to add?

Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  This is a very busy two week trip.&#xC2;&#xA0; There will be times when tiredness sets it as it is very 'full on'.&#xC2;&#xA0; If the land only tour is selected it may be a good idea to arrive a day or two before the actual tour date to get over the flight and get the batteries re-charged.

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  There were a number of inspirational moments on this trip - I personally loved the boat trip on Halong Bay, the Historic town of Hoi An and waterside living in the Mekong Delta.   What did you think of your group leader?  Khiem, the group leader, looked after us all very well and took us to fantastic restaurants. Our group was diverse but he was very inclusive and patient.  I'm especially grateful to him for keeping me safe on the roads.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  This is not a physically demanding holiday in terms of hiking and climbing mountains but an awful lot is crammed into a short time and there is no time for relaxation.

Meeting such lovely people in Vietnam, an amazing country. Staying in the home stay was a high light and the locals seem to want to share part of their lives with us.   What did you think of your group leader?  Tuyen-Vu was fantastic. Our group of 15 - aged between 30-75 all had different needs but he managed to look after us all and make sure we all had a great holiday. His knowledge was amazing and his social skills with organising taxi's, meals and&#xC2;&#xA0;cyclo tours&#xC2;&#xA0;second to none. Anyone who has Tuyen as their group leader are in for a great adventure.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Book&#xC2;&#xA0;yourself on the next trip and discover what Vietnam has to offer! If you book flights via Exodus request seats together, while they can't guarantee you will sit together it did work on all our long haul flights.Go with the flow - while we did stick to the trip notes a majority of the time sometimes opportunities come up that you have to grab.Take both Vietnam Dong and US Dollars- While at bigger stores, restaurants&#xC2;&#xA0;and the tour guide accept dollars some smaller places only prefer to take local currency. Don't always assume restaurants take debit/credit cards, they don't.   Is there anything else you would like to add?  Starting in the north of Vietnam allows you to get use to the heat.

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  So many great experiences but I would highlight Hoi An, which I was really looking forward to, and which didn't disappoint and the Mekong Delta &#xC2;&#xA0;experience. The stay at Hue had &#xC2;&#xA0;much more than I anticipated and Ho Chi Min City&#xC2;&#xA0;was &#xC2;&#xA0;significantly better than I thought it would be and the history gave an extra edge to this &#xC2;&#xA0;element of the trip. The Vietnames people were &#xC2;&#xA0;extremely welcoming.   What did you think of your group leader?  Thuy was fantastic and I would love to go on another trip with him. So well organised everything ran like clockwork and we always knew &#xC2;&#xA0;where we &#xC2;&#xA0;were up to. He shared so much information with us regarding Vietnamese culture and history as &#xC2;&#xA0;well as his own family's story which you just don't get from the guidebooks. He was good at spending time with individual group members and really interacting with them.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  As other reviewers have said pack light there is loads to buy very cheaply and it is easy to get washing done half way through the trip. I wasn't impressed with Nha Trang or with the swimming/snorkelling trip there but it was redeemed by the fact that a small group of us walked out to the Cham Towers which were extremely interesting and as I hadn't been to My Son gave &#xC2;&#xA0;a feel of this different culture.

For me as a single traveller, the most challenging aspect of the holiday was travelling in a group with people i didnt know but this added to the experience.     What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?

It was a mix of an adventure in every sense from the many different (and often novel!) modes of transport we took and encountered during the two weeks, a culinary adventure experiencing different regional specialities and a sightseeing adventure from centuries old pagodas to the Cu Chi Tunnels from the Vietnam War. If you want to sample what Vietnam is all about this is the trip for you!   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Each place we visited had a highlight, from learning how to cook delicious Vietnamese food from an entertaining chef in Hoi An, kayaking around the many and mysterious islands in Halong Bay, visiting the My Son temple complex, exploring Tu Duc's mausoleum, the sights and smells of Hue market, crawling along the tunnels at Cu Chi to taking a cyclotaxi ride around Ho Chi Minh City, every day had numerous inspirational moments. The Vietnamese people are amongst the friendliest I've met which added to the experience. I would highly recommend visiting Vietnam for the sheer variety on offer.   What did you think of your group leader?  Zung made the history and culture of Vietnam come to life and helped us to understand their customs and way of life. This was an invaluable way of getting a better understanding of the country and the people around us, which I definitely won't have got the most out of if I had visited Vietnam on my own.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Book this trip now before Vietnam changes!!! You won't regret it. Don't forget to bring tropical strength DEET for the Mekong Delta as the mosquitoes in that part of Vietnam were particularly vicious!   Is there anything else you would like to add?  I got so much out of this holiday both in terms of the sights I saw, the activities I did and the people I met. Having the opportunity to have dinner at a local family's house was a real highlight as not only was the cooking excellent but the company was warm and welcoming too. Since the iternary allowed for free time along the way you could make this either a relaxing holiday or a real jam packed sightseeing one which suited the group dynamics well."},{"rating":"2.0","review":"It was a great country but the demographic i.e. mainly older couples, lack of night time activities and more exciting daytime activities were lacking for me.

What did you think of your group leader?  Was initially dissapointed as took an early dive on the 2nd night and decided we didin't need a group meal, the first three days were tough as lack of information on what we were doing and not properly kitted out for the day trip. However; once he asked what was wrong and I explianed he bent over backwards to make the trip really enjoyable. Very knowledgeable guide who was proud of his country and clearly enjoyed his job.

The Homestay in the Mekong Delta was wonderful, and gave the chance to meet some of the locals and experience life away from the hussle and bussle of the cities.  I loved the Imperial city of Hue, and also relaxed Hoi An - unfortunately we had fairly wet weather whilst we were in the middle of the country, so maybe didn't see them quite at their best - we were lucky to get out on bikes in Hoi An which allowed us to experience the motorbikes and scooters at a different pace than just trying to cross the road - which really is an experience (check out some videos on Youtube before you go).  We also got the chance to visit an orphanage in Hoi An which was quite moving, as was the War Remnants museum in Saigon. Halong Bay is stunning, and it was lovely to get out kayaking amongst the limestone karsts and the overnight boat trip was great.  The train journey from Danang to Nha Trang, whilst long and perhaps a little uncomfortable allowed you to see much more scenery than you ever do in a coach, so great for photo opportunities.    What did you think of your group leader?  Hai was extremely well organised, so all his arrangements went without a hitch and he was really keen to ensure that we all got to experience as much of Vietnam as we could in this busy trip.  He was really knowledgeable, and had some great anecdotes to tell about all the places we visited.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Pack light, but be prepared that it might well rain a lot whilst you are there.  Leave plenty of space for shopping as there are loads of opportunities through the trip to buy some great things.  You can get washing done easily in Hoi An.  If you are looking for a relaxing holiday, this might not be the trip for you, be prepared for some long days.  As others have mentioned, be really careful of your possessions when you are out and about - it is very difficult for Vietnamese to leave the country, so our passports are very valuable to them as well as to us.  Keep your wits about you in the big cities, but do visit the markets and bargain, you can get some fantastic deals.  If you want to get clothes made in Hoi An, take some pictures with you to give ideas to the tailors, and be prepared to go for two or three fittings - persevere and as long as you have gone to a recommended tailor (ask your guide, they will know the good places) you will get a great result at the end.   Is there anything else you would like to add?  The Homestay in the Mekong was more comfortable than we had all expected - we were in rooms of max 4 people, and couples got their own rooms.  The food was delicious and the toilets/showers were clean and plentiful.  I would have preferred to spend less time in the cities and more time out in the more rural parts of Vietnam, but if you are a city lover, you will love this trip.  Remember, Vietnam is still very much a developing country, so standards might not be quite as good as you would get on a similar trip in say Thailand, but eating out and drinks are very good value, so you can get much more for your money whilst you are there.  The food is fantastic too!  If you want to visit Vietnam, I'd suggest you go soon, to experience it before it gets too developed and tourism spoils it!"}]},{"name":"Sapa Biking from Hanoi - 3 Days","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip lovely country and lovely people ,the tour covered a large part of the country and we learnt a lot .Apart from having our phone charger stolen from our room in Da nang, It was plugged into the wall and removed we did complain but ????

Everything was very responsive and on the right tracks, they advised us a very great tour program, in which we can combine so many different touring activities for both parents & kids together. We were not only engaging sightseeing trips at famous travel sites like Angkor, Killing Fields, Mekong, Hanoi, Halong bay but also handing on cooking classes, biking & joining charity programs at schools. All hotels chosen by DNQ are just centrally located, highly ranked on the tripadvisor and nearby restaurants, markets, shopping centers. Guides in regions were so friendly, well-educated, good at speaking English & professional.

The highlight if the tour is Halong Bay. The worse part of the tour was in Hanoi. The guide was barely comprehensible and fellow travellers remarked he looked like he doesn't enjoy his job. I was the only person who tipped him, and it was out of symphaty. As the tours were conducted by different companies, we visited the tourist traps- the lacquer painting places at least 4 times in different cities!! The Ambassador hotel in Ho Chi Ming is filthy . Sheets were clean but housekeeping didn't change the duvet covers!!!  There's no explanation of interesting sights along the way- explanation is given only about the sites visited. Also no help offered about places to shop or eat.

Vietnam adventure tour team did all their best to keep this tour as smooth as possible. I should say that the Vietnam adventure tour outsources the activities for their tour. It means that you will have a new tour guide and will be part of a new team every day.  Tours in Ho Chi Minh city and Pho Quoc island were organized very well but Hanoi was a disappointment. Hotels were good. Breakfasts in all hotels were really nice. Let's have a look on tour day by day. \nDay 1: Arrival. The taxi collected us from the airport, took us to the hotel. No problem.\nDay 2: we were collected from the hotel on time and instead of taken for the city tour were taken to Cu Chi tunnel. The tour guide was a bit lazy, he could give more information about the tunnel. He focused a lot on his own life during the war. After the tunnel visit about 15:00 we were back to the city and had a little time for city tour. We had to remind the guide what was in our itinerary for the day. At first, he only wanted to take us to Independence palace but we pointed to him that we have more than that.  \nDay 3 and 4: Mekong Delta tour. This was the highlight of the tour. The guide was EXCELLENT! Plenty of activities to do. We were part of a big group (44 people) but guide paid attention to everybody. At the end of day 4 we had to travel by public transport on our own. We were promised by Vietnam Adventure tours that travel guide will put us on the bus but this did not happen as he had to take other people back to Ho Chi Minh city. He booked bus tickets and taxi to the bus station for us but we had to collect tickets and find the right bus ourselves. So be prepared :) !\nDay 5 and 6: Travel to Pho Quoc Island -No problem. Problem was that guide could not speak English very well and we were part of Vietnamese tourists group. We did not get much information about the places we visited on Pho Quoc island but there were plenty of activities to do.\nDay 7: Arrived in Hanoi. The taxi collected us - no problem.\nDay 8 and 9: Ha Long Bay tour. We were told that we will be collected from our hotel at 7:30. This did not happen! We had to contact Vietnam adventure tour office twice in order to find when we will be collected. We were collected at 8:40!!! 1hour 10 min late. It would be good if we could be informed about the timing better. Even hotel staff was asking us if they could help to sort out the situation. Activities during the Ha Long bay tour were good. Overnight accommodation was surprisingly good. Meals were delicious. \nDay 10: Departure. This was stressful! We were told by Vietnam adventure tour that they arranged a taxi to take us to the airport at 17:00. The taxi was LATE AGAIN! It arrived at 17:20 after several calls to Vietnam adventure tour office. We even started booking Grab taxi ourselves. Staff at the hotel reception said that it is better to allow about 3 hours before the flight for comfortable arrival at the airport. Our flight was at 20:25. Traffic is really bad in Hanoi. It took us about 1 hour to get to the airport  (airport 13 miles from Hanoi old town area).\nThis tour could be excellent if the transportation in Hanoi would be better. But anyway we should say a big thanks to Vietnam adventure tours for the great service. I would advise to book this tour to my friends without hesitation."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"I am so glad we booked with #Vietnam Adventure Tours through #Tourradar. It was an unforgetable trip!!

From start, tour manager, Mahn from Vietnam Real Tours contacted me and continued to provide excellent communication throughout the tour. We wished to update the tour to provide extra days in a couple of places along the way. As it was a busy time of Tet festival, some of the journey details were rearranged by Mahn who dealt with all bookings to accommodate our wishes so we did not miss any part of the tour. The tour was excellent, providing flexibility with dates on each component from pick up from airport to hotel to day trip and continuation of journey. All happened so seamlessly as organised by Mahn which took any stress out of bookings to fit within 15 day stay without visa. The hotels booked on the tour by Mahn were thoughtfully located to explore areas and of the best quality. I had an injury whilst in tour and Mahn arranged an upgrade for us to make me comfortable having to miss a day trip. I thank him for his care with this. The sight seeing trips arranged for us were great too. Good English speaking and variety to give us taste of Vietnam. I normally arrange all components of a journey when travelling lots in SE Asia, to save cost. However, thought for short time, first time to Vietnam, it was easy to have independence of dates but everything arranged for us. Definitely worth the price to know good research has been done by to our manager having knowledge and communication with all hotels and drivers already. Small price to pay. Thank you so much, Mahn.

The long days and bad roads were definitely worth it. Our driver & guide were both fabulous. Visiting Sapa and walking around a local village was excellent but would have been better to stay in Sapa at a lodge or homestay rather than travel to Bac Ha and stay in a hotel. I would suggest that on the first day the tour should stay in Sapa - to have more free time to relax or enjoy a local restaurant and then travel to the Bac Ha markets the next day. I know it would be an early start but I think it would be worth it. The only thing we saw in Bac Ha was the markets. Pan Hou Lodge was fabulous as was the scenery along the way.

The damage to the country must have been heartbreaking at the time but the Vietnamese appear to have put it behind them with a determination to only look to the future and continue to improve their relationship with the Americans.

Kayaking round islands and seeing the monkeys leap from tree to tree. Learning to cook by imitation and gestures in the Mekong Delta. Walking through emerald green paddy fields, up steep hills. Sleeping on a bamboo floor in a traditional Thai longhouse. Handling a python in the snake farm. Being entertained by local dancers, and being dragged up to dance the finale. Cycling through villages on windy canal paths, with little children rushing out to shout &quot;hello!&quot;.Â What did you think of your group leader?A wonderful story teller, full of interesting anecdotes and insights into Vietnam history and culture. He even got out his guitar on occasion and entertained us with some of his songs!Do you have any advice for potential travellers?Be prepared for lots of travel, by coach, rail, road, boat, kayak, and air. Bring earplugs and a jumper, as Vietnam can dip below 20 degrees in the evenings. Be ready for all sorts of extras not necessarily on the itinerary. Don't worry about the Cu Chi tunnels: the bit you walk through is only right at the end and easily omitted if you're claustrophobic - the rest of it is fascinating.Â Is there anything else you would like to add?Just remember it's a communist country and you won't necessarily get the same picture as at home in the more political, government-run places of interest that you visit, though they are very interesting. Be ready to supplement your visit with extra research online!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Truly amazing place and well thought out trip, which really does make it feel like you have seen so much of the country. Some truly stunning sights (Halong bay is the second wonder of the world). Hanoi is a complete culture shock and impressive to see how many people can fit onto one moped. Food is very good and for very little you can get some very impressive street food. Only slight complaint not as physical as the itinerary makes it sound.What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?Halong bay was my favourite part of the trip, kayaking from the boat to a lagoon then watching a monkey sitting the rocks eating. Hoi an was a close second with cycling at six in the morning to watch the sunrise over the spice fields (helped by the fact it was snowing in England at the time).What did you think of your group leader?Pheong was a brilliant fella, informative with a deep love of his country, always cheerful and amazingly patient, one morning even giving a meditation lesson for those who were interested and not only all that also a fantastic pool player.Do you have any advice for potential travellers?Be warned Hanoi and northern Vietnam can be colder than expected, although my trip was in January so maybe I should have been better prepared. Don't overpack you can get your laundry done at lots of different places on the trip. Also shopping is very good out there I bought a north face jacket for 45 dollars which is'nt too bad.Is there anything else you would like to add?Don't bother changing your money into Dong, stick with dollars it's easier to keep track of what your spending and they are accepted everywhere."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This tour is not for the faint at heart.

Giang,s calm and ever willingness to help make him a strong candidate for leader of the year.Do you have any advice for potential travellers?Pack light as it is hot in the south. the north can be cool in the winter but the payback is the dry season. Saigon is the best local beer!"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"An excellent and varied trip with a great group of people who gelled together instantly.What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?The overnight stays in the stilthouses were great fun,and a great way for us all to get to know eachother.Also the cycling in the Mekong Delta was pretty special.What did you think of your group leader?Mao was the best group leader I've had when doing many of these trips.He started as our leader and left as our friend!

Vietnam is like nothing you've experienced before!"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"A really enjoyable trip. Fascinating cultural experiences in the tribes, spectacular and relaxing Halong Bay, the madness of Hanoi, and the sights of the rest of Vietnam. A couple of days of trekking, but more walking after that. Still tiring due to the heat/humidity, early starts and some long bus rides. Well worth the experience.What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?The hiking through the hills out from Mai Chau was great even though it was incredibly hot. Very interesting visiting the tribes and hearing their stories.\nAlso the boat trip in Halong Bay - the seafood dinner, the kayaking, the swimming, the relaxing on the ship's deck, the scenery. Awesome.\nCu Chi tunnels. Really interesting while also a little freaky experience.What did you think of your group leader?Linh was great. Organised us really well, and looked after us well with pointing out good restaurants etc when going to be on our own, and taking us to really good restaurants when with him. We ate REALLY well!\n\nWas really informative, explained a lot about how the hill tribe people live and their past etc. Ended up telling the same things a couple of times, and sometimes would go off on a tangent, turning a piece on the pagoda etc we were at into a long winded story of his childhood. But mostly told good stuff.\n\nIs a little quirky, which made it entertaining with some of his songs. Has a lot of character, which has left us with a great memories to retell amongst group members.\n\nOverall, Linh was really great value.Do you have any advice for potential travellers?Take a light weight jacket with you in case it rains at any moment (even though it'll likely only be brief).\nSay so at the beginning if you don't like fish (or anything for that matter), you'll get well catered for with other food for you. A few people on our trip didn't say so until halfway through, after a number of entrees and meals with fish, so didn't eat as much those times.Is there anything else you would like to add?Only thing might have liked different, was a little more time in Hoi An. We essentially only had less than a couple of hours after dark the day we arrived to do any shopping.  This was the only time we had to order stuff to be tailor made, and it was quite a rush to do in that time, and after dark so it was tricky to see. We had plenty of free time the next afternoon, but as we were leaving too early the next day we couldn't order anything then as there wasn't enough time to get it made.\n\nWhen that is what Hoi An is so well known for, we were very rushed to achieve it, and definitely would have done more with the chance. \n\nThat would be only real gripe about the trip.\n\nOh and the overnight train wasn't exactly comfortable!\n\nI come from a country/culture where we don't tip, so having the group tipping kitty and Linh taking care of it was great, and quite a relief."},{"rating":"3.0","review":"Vietnam is a fascinating place, and this trip really covers it, from north to south, taking in all the sights and all the places you would expect.  All very slick, very smooth, good locations, and a fascinating tour guide.

Best guide I have had in 30 odd years of travelling. Never met a guy so hell bent on making sure every one was happy.

Bonkers but great, especially as at one point it must have been like hearding cats. very good local knowledge. would stop and show you anything, although that did mean we tried a few wierd and wonderful things including snails and fish eyeballs; Beer corner with the loacls, sugar cane drinks and much more.

The trip was hectic, perhaps too hectic at times and does not allow enough time in each place to really soak in the local atmosphere or to explore on your own. Felt like we were on a strict schedule which could not be altered – too 'organised' and too much 'tour guide chat' for my liking.   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Despite appalling weather and the cold, Halong Bay was spectacular and the boat we were on was excellent as was the food provided. Trekking in the hills north of Hanoi was tough but brilliant – the flora was amazing and witnessing the incredible hard work needed to grow rice was quite humbling – I'll never complain at the price in the supermarket ever again!The mopeds. Sheer entertainment, you never knew what you were going to see next transported on one the thousands on the road – could be dozens of eggs, chickens or even someone with his leg in plaster and crutches! The food everywhere was terrific and I am definitely converted to this style of cooking – bring on the fish sauce! Cycling was fun but quite intensive in the Mekong Delta, especially if you're not so young or fit!    What did you think of your group leader?  Our guide was full of information and history which was good but it was a case of information overload at times. Added to this, being a local (which is good) however, his English was not always understandable which did not help. His instructions about the next day's schedule and arrangements was often lost in translation leaving some members of the group confused as to what was needed or happening. This all sounds a bit negative but he was a very nice person who was trying to please and show off his country. I feel the culture difference e.g. his and our expectations, was a bit of a barrier. "},{"rating":"3.0","review":"Loved Vietnam, beautiful food, stunning scenery, fascinating history.

There is a lot crammed in so an extra two days would have been perfect. A few things here and there could be improved on but overall it was a fantastic holiday.   What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  It would have to be the drive through the mountains on our way to Danang/Hue/Hoi An as well as Trekking in Hoa Binh. There are many others but those two stand out for me personally. I also loved cycling in Hoi An and then ending the day on the beach.. couldn't have asked for anything better.   What did you think of your group leader?  He could improve his organisation skills a bit more but he is a very nice guy and we had a great time with him, he was sad when we left and so were we. Shared a few beers and laughs, very down to earth.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  This is not an easy tour, don't be selfish and think about it before going and slowing the whole group down. We had that happen with us and it makes everyone feel frustrated especially with cycling when it is so so so hot out there. You will be up as early as 6am every day so it is not a relaxing holiday, it's on the go every day.   Is there anything else you would like to add?  I would definitely ask Exodus to review this and maybe add 2 more days. I'd also recommend an easy last day because the cycling in Mekong Delta was painful and everyone was tired by the last evening. Maybe a beach day? That would be the perfect ending to a brilliant tour."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Excelllent holiday, well run tour with lots of different experiances.

The quality of the hotels and homestays were better than expected and perhaps Exodus undersold this in the Trip notes.   Our only concern was the cycling which for the most part was not on quiet backroads. These do not exist in Vietnam.Finally, the four day extension to Angkor Wat can only be described as fantastic. One could easily spend a week or more taking in the magnificent temples.       What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?  Walking in the hill tribe villages in Northern Vietnam  was  the highlight  of the Vietnam segment. People leading simple lives the way they have for hundreds of years, apart from now having the almost universal motorcycle. The scenery is stunning with paddy fields as far as the eye can see set against a backdrop of the northern hills.   What did you think of your group leader?  Our group leader, Hai, was knowledgeable and enthusiastic  about  his country.  From the moment  he  met  us off the flight in Hanoi until he said goodbye in Saigon there was never a dull moment. Only once did he lose his cool as did most of the group, when a very large millipede decided to visit us at our homestay. A truly hilarious episode.   Do you have any advice for potential travellers?  Although there is not a huge amount of physical activity on this trip the heat and humidity makes the walking and cycling moderately challenging. Unless you are a regular cyclist, cycling in Vietnam can be daunting:  there is no such thing as a quiet road, even on narrow paths and bridges you will encounter motobikes, scooters, tuk tuks and other various improvised means of transport.  Whilst this adds to the enchantment of vietnamese roads, the levels of polution, even in the countryside are high, the constant sound of blaring horns deafening; drivers do not give way they just sound their horn and keep going. Most of the cycling was during the hotest part of the day so take the advice of the tour leader and have frequent stops for water and go at your own pace as it easy to think the ride is a race. The trip notes definitely undersell the quality of the accommodation in the hotels and homestays. Having travelled to Cuba with Exodus where some of the hotels are adequate but basic all the hotels on this trip were  far superior. The advice in the trip notes to travel light is well founded and a backpack or holdall is all that is needed. A daypack is useful. Eating rat, crocodile and water buffalo may sound awful but they are not that bad. Seriously though, the food was excellent throughout but vegetarians may struggle at times to find many dishes.   Is there anything else you would like to add?  The Angkor Wat etension really is well worth doing and I suspect not publicised well enough in the brochure.

The team were very friendly and willing to go above and extra to make sure the trip was exactly what I wanted\nThe guide Ling very helpful knowledgeable can highly recommend this company"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"I've given an overall rating, but this tour was a mixed bag so I've broken it down. \n\nDay one was 5 stars, the tour guide, meal and hotel were all really good and my only complaint was how little sleep I'd had traveling over from Thailand. I was picked up straight from the airport by two very friendly tour operators, taken to my hotel, given time to shower and reset before heading out into Da Nang.\n\nIt was just me and the guide, a young woman from Da Nang, which at first I thought would be awkward, but she was so friendly and very knowledgeable, I saw the lady Buddha, marble Mountain and a museam that was very interesting. Then she took me to what turned out to be my favourite meal of the trip before bedtime. Definitely my favourite day all round. \n\nThe next day started at 8am, there was some confusion over my hotel arrangements, but that got sorted quick enough before we left for Hue. \nThis tour was packed and aside from moving a little too quick it was also very good, we had a comfy air conned bus, we were given ponchos when it rained and we had a very nice meal again. Another female tour guide was also very helpful, knowledgable and patient with 4 different languages on tour. Again the hotel was good, though possibly not quite as nice, still a 4 star day. \n\nThe third day and again early start with some confusion about where I would be staying next. Young male tour guide this time and he was lovely, infectious smile and 100/100 for effort. Unfortunately I saw some of the same things again, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I was surprised to be getting repeats. This tour finished very early too, but I did meet some people to have dinner with which was nice. \n\nThis hotel was a let down though, in such a beautiful city it felt depressing, dirty and the customer service was stretched thin. It looked like it was half closed and in desperate need of updating. Fortunately I spent my night here out with friends from the tour, so the room wasn't used as much. But day 3 for the tour was more 3 star.\n\nDay 4 was the biggest dissapointment. The arranged tour was only for the morning and it was a solo guide, no driver too. I wouldn't have minded this and was especially open after the first day's experience, but this very quickly turned awkward and then very uncomfortable. \n\n- The heat was really getting to me by this point, obviously not the tour people's fault, however there was no air conned vehicle available this day, nor was there ready access to water as there had been on the days before. \n\n- He did not provide a helmet when I first got on the back of his bike, something I felt I had to do as it was ride or walk.\n\n- He stood by and watched as I was pulled over by a market vendor and held hostage for a dollar photo I did not want.\n\n- He wouldn't stop flirting, no matter how politely I tried to dissuade him, he kept making flirty comments. It was just me and him throughout this tour and I was becoming more and more irritated by this. This is not acceptable behaviour and I did complain to the tour operator, but I got no response or apology for this.\n\n\nBy the time we'd reached the river I was almost in tears and really panicing that I might faint and be left to the mercy of this guy. So I cut the tour short and asked the operator to arrange another hotel room for me, which he did. Although the operator did not apologise for the tour guides behaviour he did also arrange for lunch to be sent to me with a spend limit of 150,000 dong.\n\nIf I had been picked up at the right time after this then that would've been the end, but sadly after managing to recover a little I was then rushed out, driven to Da Nang 4 hours earlier than needed, given a lukewarm meal which I ate alone and was then silenty dropped at the train station where I had a 2 hour 45 minute wait for the train.\n\nSo when I said mixed bag, I meant it. This tour went from being fantastic to dissapointing and then a bit scary if I'm honest. Really not sure if I would recommend or go for them again. That last day was so poor, it's a shame, but it does spoil what started so well and genuinely was worth every penny right up until that point."}]},{"name":"Terrific Hanoi Motorcycle Tour to Pu Luong and Mai Chau","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Home stay accommodation was excellent and we saw a wide range of the cuisine that the region has to offer.

There are cultural differences obviously, but itbwas amazing. The trip offered the best, and was well organised. Go and eat pho!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The holiday of a lifetime, absolutely superb in every way.What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?Every single day had an inspirational moment, its impossible to single one out. The range of transport was amazing - from cyclo rickshaw to overnight train, Â to luxury cruiseship in HaLong bay with cycling and boats in between.Â What did you think of your group leader?Tom/Tho should be given an Exodus award for being the most enthusiastic, knowledgeable and endlessly patient group leader. He really went the extra mile to make sure that everything ran smoothly and that we had a great time. He was particularly good with the childrenDo you have any advice for potential travellers?make sure you get some clothes made in Hoi An - I came back wishing Id bought more.Is there anything else you would like to add?An amazing holiday for the whole family. We were lucky with the weather: Â summertime is rainy season in the North of Vietnam and a typhoon arrived just after we had left which closed Ha Long bay."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"A great introduction to a wonderful country, the Vietnamese people are a delight, the food is great and the scenery varied and beautiful from the full-on buzz of Hanoi and Saigon to the peace and tranquility of Halong Bay and the Mekong DeltaWhat was the most inspirational moment of your trip?Cruising amongst the Karst peaks in Halong Bay was amazing but the revelation for me was the Vietnamese people, so friendly and with an extrordinary capacity for forgiveness towards their former enemies.What did you think of your group leader?Zung was great, so enthusiastic, always smiling with a great sense of humour and particularly good with the teenagers.&nbsp;Do you have any advice for potential travellers?The food is great so don't worry about taking fussy children, you are bound to find something they will like. The War museum in Ho Chi Minh city contains some deeply shocking photos and accounts of atrocities - I would say it is essential that adults visit but it is tough and not suitable for younger childrenIs there anything else you would like to add?The holiday catered so well for the whole family with enough activities to keep the teenagers happy, kayaking, swimming, mud baths, snorkelling etc but also managed to fit in a few cultural and historical trips and as I've mentioned, the food is just fantastic, can't remember a meal that wasn't delicious!My only crticism was that the cooking class was very poor, we have attended cooking classes in China and Morocco and they were both great but the one in Hoi An was more of a cooking demo than a class, hardly involving the group, going so fast that you couldn't take it in and then there was such a long time between the demo and the food being served that we got the distinct impression that they were just interested in selling as many drinks to the tourists as possible! All the kids were bored stiff. I'm sure this could be easily remedied by Exodus choosing a different class as there seemed to be lots available.Â "},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Had a wonderful 2 weeks in Vietnam this summer on this trip.

We were picked up on time from Hanoi airport by our guide, Tang Kim Dung she took us to the hotel and made sure that everything was in order before she left. Next day she was there on time. Very knowledgable and efficient, she gave good explanation of everything. I must mention the driver, ver polite, he kept an immaculate car and always had fresh water for us, a lovely touch. We were picked up on time for our trip to Halong Bay, all went well but I am not sure what we received for our additional $25 per person for the galla evening, not even a glass of champers at midnight, some cheap stuff that wasn't drinkable. Please don't get me wrong the crew were great but I sensed that quite rightly they were always great. Guide then picked us up for our trip to Sapa, again she ensured we were safely on board and settled before she left. Sapa - well this was a bit of a disappointment. Our itinerary stated a trek, what we got was a 2 hour walk on a proper road, yes there were interesting things to see, but there were lots of people on the same road. We then stopped for lunch for a hour, we had anticipated further walking in the afternoon but our guide dropped us off at 12.50. The rest of the day was free but there is nothing to do in Sapa if your not out trekking, very disappointing. The guide was informative but also annoying as he was often on his mobile phone. Next morning the guide suggested leaving at 7 am, from our experience the day before I said 7.30. In reality we could have left at 9. Lovely 2 hour drive, we stopped at the market, which is like any other market in Asia , so no need to have 2 hrs there. We couldn't do the river trip as the river was too dry due to the dam restricting the flow of water. So we were back in our destination by 12 MD with 9 hours to fill in, in a City that has nothing for tourists. Here our guide was very helpful and got us a room in a hotel but it was a long wait, so we did two ten hour trips on a train for 2 hours walking, a three hour drive the next day. ( which was enjoyable) and 45 mins at a market. Please sort this out for others. I am sure that others have said this but Sapa is now very commercialised and you may want to suggest other things for the itenary. I hope you find this useful, it is intended to be.

I was the ONLY person on this group tour \n2. I did not have a tour guide with me \n\nI am and was completely baffled during the whole tour, being a female solo traveller who had just volunteered in a hospital in Ho Chi Minh and had treated myself to this amazing sounding tour so I could explore Vietnam with other people. Mainly so I was not alone and for the safety of other people and a tour guide.\n\nAfter just day two I realized I had booked something that had been completely misrepresented and I was distressed.\nSo I emailed a complaint to Legend Travel Group and Indochina Legend as once booked via Tour Rador these were the companies who sent me my itinerary and details of the tour. There were 9 email address who received my complaint and I did not receive one reply. This is when I realized I was in trouble.\n\nBelow are the details of the trip that has left me very distressed and upset and wondering why or how this could of happened, I am a strong individual and it was not my first time in Vietnam. I am not a naive and vulnerable traveller but still this group tour or lack of (as I was the only person) has left me extremely upset and distraught. I want answers.\n\nDay 1 –  Friday 24th November \nI arrived to Hanoi, met by a man who didn’t speak English and didn’t tell me where I was going, he simply pointed to a car and I dragged my bag over.\nI arrive at the hotel and I am met by a man and told I am the only person getting the 8 hour night train to Sapa. Himself who I assume was the English speaking tour guide and no other guests on the tour would be joining me.\nI then thought I was having a Private Deluxe Cabin on the train as stated online (plus I had paid the extra single supplement so I didn’t have to share) but instead I was told I was having a shared cabin, so I paid an extra 2,200,000VND ($128AUD) cash to get the Private cabin. I then travelled alone - no tour group, no tour guide.\n\nDay 2 –  Saturday 25th November \nThe driver who picked me up at Sapa in a busy mini bus (I was relieved and hoped these people were on my tour, sadly they weren’t, I again was the only person on this group tour) didn't give me the correct details of my hotel, he gave me a piece of paper with \"11 Maong Hoa\" which was incorrect and pointed down the road but I did not know this was incorrect so proceeded to walk to the location following my satellite navigation. I had called the man who had put me on the train and he said the hotel was U Sapa not knowing the hotel has renamed to BB hotel. I got lost and upset and started to feel distressed, I then had another man call me and I met him at the legend hotel, I then assumed he was the English Tour Guide (he was not).\n\nI then start my Sapa trek which wasn't great – I was directed to go with a local native non English speaking woman, it was so muddy and slippery it was dangerous. I fell over so many times I had to turn back and go a different way with the woman who did not speak any English. We were also not informed on the level of difficulty of the trek, nor that we should wear gumboots.\nThere was no picnic lunch? But instead a lunch served to us, which was spoilt by many many women forcing us to buy products. After this I left.\n\nFinally I get to the BB Hotel to check in and the reception have no record of my name, so I then have to call the other man who I had met in the morning to speak Vietnamese. I then check in. Hotel is very nice but was ruined due to screaming children running the hallway outside my room and the connecting door to my room are having a party. I made two complaints to reception. Reception said I can't move rooms as they are fully booked so I cried myself to sleep.\n\nDay 3 –  Sunday 26th November \nI checkout and I join a mini bus with other people and we drive to Bac Ha Market and a local village.\nWe were in the fully packed mini bus for over 6.5 hours that’s 3.5 hours there and 3 hours back with us spending a total of 2.5 hours out of the mini bus.\nThis I could deal with as I was with other people and enjoyed having human contact.\nHowever what frustrated and upset me about this day was getting dropped at the train station at 4.30pm……. my train was not till 9.40pm! That is over a 5 hour wait on my own, alone as I had no one on my group tour, what and why was this done, this is not acceptable.\nThe train station is not in a nice part of town and I was constantly harassed by men wanting to wash shoes and at one point had my shoes taken off my feet until I started screaming, they were then returned.\nAfter a 5 hour wait I was then be told my train ticket I had paid $128 AUD for was NOT A RETURN! I then got in a shared cabin with a family of 4 for an 8-hour train journey back to Hanoi.\n\nDay 4 –  Monday 27th November \nI spent the day alone in Hanoi, as I had no other people on my group tour and no English-speaking tour guide. I was lonely and upset. I still had no reply to email complaint.\n \nDay 5 –  Tuesday 28th November \nTo upset and angry to go on my tour.\n\nDay 6 \nI joined the boat trip to Halong Bay called GARDEN BAY CRUISE this was lovely and would recommended booking separately it would be far cheaper just 500,000VND just $29 AUD.\n\nDay 7 \nI had a nice time at Halong Bay.\n\nAs you can imagine I am livid as my trip was completely ruined due to what I booked being completely untrue and misrepresented, I did not get what I paid for and it has left me very upset.\n\n:( Laura "},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Hi Ms Nguyen\n\nYour services were excellent and I will be recommending your company to friends and colleagues who may be wanting to travel to Vietnam.\n\nI am hoping to get back to Hanoi later sometime mid-year as I would like to visit Sapa, so will definitely be in contact again with you.\n\nKind regards\n"}]},{"name":"Seven Days Discover Real Charm North Vietnam","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"They were very helpful. I planned for my trip but then I had to reschedule due to Visa problems and they helped me reschedule. Very nice and very organized"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"This tour was actually a combination of a few smaller tours combined. Each segment I found myself with different people. \nInitially I was uncertain if I’d made a wise decision as on the first scheduled day of activities, nobody came to pick me up from the hotel. Eventually a lady came and explained/apologised for the situation. The bus had gone without me, traffic problems etc. I was offered some cash to help compensate. Luckily for me I had a free day at the end which I was able to substitute for the initial missed day, so it all worked out. The man in charge (who I’d met the day before)was extremely apologetic & very good with communication at all times....especially when I got nervous about future pick ups!\nThe hotel was a good base to come back to each time in between the overnight trips to Halong Bay & Sapa. Staff here were friendly & looked after luggage while I was away overnight. \nThe boat was quite old looking, but seemed to be the case for most on the bay. It was safe though, food really good & great activities while on this segment of trip. Not too much space around the bed itself to move around. \nThe home stay with the tribal people is very basic and may not be suitable for everyone. If you’re young, energetic & keen to see the simpler side of life then definitely go for it. It is very basic though. Cement floor, hard bed but has a mosquito net & there’s a lightbulb dangling freely from roof. To access the shower you needed to walk down a narrow sloping track which becomes very slippery after the rain. \nLeaving the place the following day I also nearly slipped down the trails which had become dangerously slick due to heavy rain overnight. The family though are kind & you’ll be fed well. Amazing considering the rudimentary kitchen!!\nThe various guides throughout the different segments of the trip were all very friendly & mostly quite good with their English language skills. \nIn summary I’d say it was good value for money, I’d recommend the trip (despite my initial concerns & the muddle up at the beginning) but suggest that for slightly older travellers (like myself) or those wanting a little more comfort, you should probably consider upgrading to something a bit more luxurious."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Everything from start to finish was well organized.

The eagerly awaited Halong bay trip, the only reason for the 5 day stay, was cut short only on arrival at the boat and after a 4 hour journey with 2 shopping stops.

I was the ONLY person on this group tour \n2. I did not have a tour guide with me \n\nI am and was completely baffled during the whole tour, being a female solo traveller who had just volunteered in a hospital in Ho Chi Minh and had treated myself to this amazing sounding tour so I could explore Vietnam with other people. Mainly so I was not alone and for the safety of other people and a tour guide.\n\nAfter just day two I realized I had booked something that had been completely misrepresented and I was distressed.\nSo I emailed a complaint to Legend Travel Group and Indochina Legend as once booked via Tour Rador these were the companies who sent me my itinerary and details of the tour. There were 9 email address who received my complaint and I did not receive one reply. This is when I realized I was in trouble.\n\nBelow are the details of the trip that has left me very distressed and upset and wondering why or how this could of happened, I am a strong individual and it was not my first time in Vietnam. I am not a naive and vulnerable traveller but still this group tour or lack of (as I was the only person) has left me extremely upset and distraught. I want answers.\n\nDay 1 –  Friday 24th November \nI arrived to Hanoi, met by a man who didn’t speak English and didn’t tell me where I was going, he simply pointed to a car and I dragged my bag over.\nI arrive at the hotel and I am met by a man and told I am the only person getting the 8 hour night train to Sapa. Himself who I assume was the English speaking tour guide and no other guests on the tour would be joining me.\nI then thought I was having a Private Deluxe Cabin on the train as stated online (plus I had paid the extra single supplement so I didn’t have to share) but instead I was told I was having a shared cabin, so I paid an extra 2,200,000VND ($128AUD) cash to get the Private cabin. I then travelled alone - no tour group, no tour guide.\n\nDay 2 –  Saturday 25th November \nThe driver who picked me up at Sapa in a busy mini bus (I was relieved and hoped these people were on my tour, sadly they weren’t, I again was the only person on this group tour) didn't give me the correct details of my hotel, he gave me a piece of paper with \"11 Maong Hoa\" which was incorrect and pointed down the road but I did not know this was incorrect so proceeded to walk to the location following my satellite navigation. I had called the man who had put me on the train and he said the hotel was U Sapa not knowing the hotel has renamed to BB hotel. I got lost and upset and started to feel distressed, I then had another man call me and I met him at the legend hotel, I then assumed he was the English Tour Guide (he was not).\n\nI then start my Sapa trek which wasn't great – I was directed to go with a local native non English speaking woman, it was so muddy and slippery it was dangerous. I fell over so many times I had to turn back and go a different way with the woman who did not speak any English. We were also not informed on the level of difficulty of the trek, nor that we should wear gumboots.\nThere was no picnic lunch? But instead a lunch served to us, which was spoilt by many many women forcing us to buy products. After this I left.\n\nFinally I get to the BB Hotel to check in and the reception have no record of my name, so I then have to call the other man who I had met in the morning to speak Vietnamese. I then check in. Hotel is very nice but was ruined due to screaming children running the hallway outside my room and the connecting door to my room are having a party. I made two complaints to reception. Reception said I can't move rooms as they are fully booked so I cried myself to sleep.\n\nDay 3 –  Sunday 26th November \nI checkout and I join a mini bus with other people and we drive to Bac Ha Market and a local village.\nWe were in the fully packed mini bus for over 6.5 hours that’s 3.5 hours there and 3 hours back with us spending a total of 2.5 hours out of the mini bus.\nThis I could deal with as I was with other people and enjoyed having human contact.\nHowever what frustrated and upset me about this day was getting dropped at the train station at 4.30pm……. my train was not till 9.40pm!

I then got in a shared cabin with a family of 4 for an 8-hour train journey back to Hanoi.\n\nDay 4 –  Monday 27th November \nI spent the day alone in Hanoi, as I had no other people on my group tour and no English-speaking tour guide. I was lonely and upset. I still had no reply to email complaint.\n \nDay 5 –  Tuesday 28th November \nTo upset and angry to go on my tour.\n\nDay 6 \nI joined the boat trip to Halong Bay called GARDEN BAY CRUISE this was lovely and would recommended booking separately it would be far cheaper just 500,000VND just $29 AUD.\n\nDay 7 \nI had a nice time at Halong Bay.\n\nAs you can imagine I am livid as my trip was completely ruined due to what I booked being completely untrue and misrepresented, I did not get what I paid for and it has left me very upset.\n\n:( Laura \n"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"The boat is not the newest available but the staff were quite friendly.

Most of us had first met on another Bamboo trip last year (Thailand/ Cambodia) and we had such a wonderful time there together, that we wanted to meet up and explore Vietnam together this year too. It was a pleasure to also have some new faces with us this year and welcome beautiful new friends into our Bamfam, who I hope will remain for a long time to come. \n\nJane and Dee, had organised our trip to the nth degree and are obviously so proud of their country that they had real passion for wanting to show us as much as possible. Always there and on hand for any questions or advice along the way. Both very hands-on and joining in with us all, so as to never leave anyone out and ensuring we were all safe and well. \n\nIf I had one criticism however, it might be only that when there is a group of people of mixed ages (our group had people in their 70s through to their 20s), it also means there is a range in physical ability too. So perhaps it would be good to have a little more downtime in one or two places (another night on the boat in Ha Long Bay would have been lovely - so beautiful). And also perhaps the bike rides could have been taken a little slower too - there were people who struggled to keep up in the heat or, who wanted to stop and take photos of the beautiful landscapes etc along the way, which it would have been a shame to miss. \n\nBut overall, the trip was amazing and I'm still juggling my brain to try and remember everything we did. And I loved the sleeper coach ride too! That was a new fun experience! A wonderful & beautiful country and thank you to both Jane and Dee for giving us all an experience which will never be forgotten xx Cherished memories xxx"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"My first bamboo tour and I had an amazing time.

Can’t wait for next tour x"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"A brilliantly planned itinerary packed full with so many experiences while still allowing for some downtime. \nOur guide was so full of passion for her country it was contagious! Would totally recommend this tour!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Ah, the trick becomes how best to describe the Bamboo Vietnam experience?  I'm not a fan of spoilers - so if that's what your looking for, you'll have to refer to another review.  What I will share instead was my very personal experience, the feeling of absolute awe at creation, at culture, and at community...\n\nAt creation... You will see sights that will challenge your mind.  You will see magesty, and you will experience wonder.  Vietnam will surprise you, and it will captivate your very senses.  It will grab ahold of you not let you go.  You will be wowed.\n\nAt culture... What a special people.  There's a sense of pride, of warmth, and of strength, that is not shouted, that is not proclaimed - it is simply demonstrated, it is made manifest.  It is woven into the very fabric, the very essence, of the people.  These are good, good people.  These are people happy to have you visit, and proud to be able to share their country with you.  From their kindness, to their attentiveness, to their capacity for execution.  You will be wowed.\n\nAt community... Now community, I can't promise you.  Because the community that our group formed was, of course, unique.  But it too was part of the life changing experience that was our Bamboo Vietnam trip.  The people that we were blessed to share in this experience with us were second to none.  After two weeks I both consider them all, each and every one of them, part of my extended family,  without reservation.  And I also miss them... which very well may be the most difficult part of the trip.  This trip bonds you with the country, with the experience, and with the people both of the country and of the group.\n\nAnd that's before even mentioning the volunteering portion.  Take the experiences described above, and infuse them with the opportunity to do something meaningful, and challenging, and difficult, and well done.  Inject into the experience the opportunity to contribute... possibly in a way that you've never before contributed.  And know that you leave a little bit of yourself, a little piece of your effort, a little piece of your soul in Vietnam.  That a portion of you will always remain there in a contributory capacity, potentially improving and amplifying another family's experience hopefully far into the unforeseeable future.\n\nAnd finally I want to give thanks, generally to the Bamboo organization for putting together such a well implemented and well executed experience.  And specifically to Jane and D, our tour guides, our organizers, and our shepards - for sharing so much of themselves, their country, and their time with us.  Often in two minute intervals. (Inside joke.)  What good and kind embassadors they were.  Conductors, who produced nothing less than a master symphony of experience.  I cannot thank them enough.  Their help and their hearts formed the lattice that everything else was stacked upon.  They were phenomenal guides.  Without them, our trip would not have been the same.\n\nSo how best to describe the Bamboo Vietnam experience?  Four words: You will experience wonders.\n\n100/100.  Do it without reservation.  O and do not miss the optional show, the last night in Hoi An.  It was world class."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Always smiling and welcoming from the minute I met her.

It was the first organised tour we had taken so we were a little worried about how we would deal with not organising things ourselves. But all pickups from hotels, bus stations and airports were on time (Such a relief!); the guides in the various cities were excellent: very professional and well-informed; hotels ranged from good to excellent; breakfasts in the hotels ranged from OK to excellent; lunches .... on days where the tour provided them...were very good."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"The taxi driver was not in a visible place when I came out of the airport in Hanoi, so I thought I would have had to make my own arrangements so I went and bought a SIM card for $15 which was unnecessary. The driver informed me he had been asked to wait by a particular gate.\n2 The Moonshine Hotel in Hanoi was dirty. The bed linen had been changed but the floor had not. The second time we went to the hotel I had a different room which was very nice, but even dirtier. I took photographs, and showed them to receptionist.\n3 There were only five of us on the tour and yet I was placed in a different hotel, Hoi An Town Home Resort while the others were in Sunshine. Mine was much further away and so more expensive to pay for a taxi on my own. I complained to Hoi An but they said they Moonshine was full and  had already paid for the hotel so could not change. They also said that as I had booked last I was the one placed there. These two statements were untrue. I could have booked at the Moonshine and I was not the last to book with you. My room was next to the restaurant which had loud music until about 10.30. The breakfast was not buffet style and had limited choice. I asked for the omelette and was given two undercooked fried eggs and they took ages to arrive. I  asked for a proper omelette, which they provided. It also meant I had limited time to get ready for the transport as I had not anticipated waiter service. There was no fruit on the menu but I was given a nicely presented selection when I asked for some. The staff were courteous and pleasant.\n4 Hoi An provide a “free” $25 voucher for a bespoke tailor made item of clothing. However most of us had to pay a minimum of $20 for the item we wanted. (I chose a dress) It also takes at least half a day between choosing the item and returning for a fitting and in some cases a second and third fit. I just accepted my dress as it was as I didn’t want to return again. I feel this just wastes time and provides more money for Hoi An Express. I would strongly recommend that they reduce the price instead of the “free” voucher and stop this nonsense. People who want bespoke tailoring can make their own arrangements at the many available shops.\n5 There is a lot of free time available but no advice of suggested tours. The last tour I went on had the same guide throughout who could suggest itineraries and even phone taxi companies for us. \n6 The guides were all very pleasant, but some of their strong accent made it difficult to fully understand. Lors Sophea (not sure of the spelling) was one of the better ones and gave us a lot of information about the country.\n7 In HCMC we had a full day itinerary. One visit was to the war museum. This was a fascinating place, but we had 30 minutes to view everything. I had time to see two rooms, while others just skipped through everything. What we did that day could have been planned over one and half days not one day so we didn’t have to rush from one to the other\nOne the whole the planning was poor and I don’t think we had good value."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"We are very impressed with the organization of this tour. The services offered by Hoi An Express in this tour as to pick up from the airport at Hanoi, Vietnam and finally dropped off at Siem Reap, Cambodia and everything in between for 14 days (itinerary, air, water and ground transportation, accommodation, meals) were outstanding.\nWe would certainly recommend this tour to our friends and family."},{"rating":"3.0","review":"Parts were good and some days were not. We had excellent guides like our last one in Cambodia, and bad ones such as the lady in Ho Chi Minh City. The grueling day from 7am until 10pm spent on a bus traveling to Cambodia should not be part of the tour. The Floating Market was not a market at all but a boat ride. The floating village in Cambodia was interesting but accessing it through the area that was full of human sewage was horrible and probably dangerous to be exposed to. Everyone including our guide had to shield their face from the stench.  Ha Long Bay boat tour was nice. Hoi An was interesting and the lanterns at night scenic. The day spent visiting the tunnels and war museum was depressing and everyone left on the last day in Vietnam on a sour note. It is relevant information and historically interesting and important- but the way it is done I would want to save my precious vacation days and visited something else.

We had a late pickup at the bus station because the driver fell asleep. The bus was horrific! It was dirty, hot, cramped, and offered no WiFi (as advertised).

Other than that we loved the tour. All our guides were excellent- including Sun in Hanoi, Bau, Hong & Peah in Cambodia. Accommodation was great( Ho Chi Minh was a little cramped  but it's a big city so we didn't expect much). Hoi An Express were excellent to deal with. A gentleman on our tour lost his jacket with bank card in it so we emailed Jenni at Hoi An as soon as we realised and she was on the phone to his emergency contact in Australia straight away.

Hoi An was quick to respond, and I found an additional tour available in Da Nang area which they were prompt to arrange as an add-on.   There was ample down time and lots of little extras, from learning about silk worms to tasting Snake Wine.

The price for the 3 star option was very reasonable and most hotel options were sufficient  - good locations, clean, good breakfast, quiet (with the exception of our hotel in Ho Chi Minh City).  All tour guides were fluent in English and happy to answer our questions. \n\nCons:​\n​Communication coming from Hoi An Express needs improvement.  Leading up to the departure there were many emails from Hoi An Express requesting bits and pieces of information - some which I had provided earlier, and some information which I already provided to Tour Radar directly.  Communication needs to be streamlined to improve efficiencies and minimize the chance of mis-communication. \n\nAmong many of the communications, we learned the day before our Ha Long Bay cruise that our cruise boat would be different from the itinerary provided.  While we didn't think too much of this, it seemed to be a trend for the rest our the tour.  We were informed our hotel in Hoi An would be \"upgraded\", and while an upgrade is always nice, the new hotel was quite a way out of town.  Our original hotel was steps from the city core and we had researched and created plans based on the original location. \n\nBe warned - the \"free\" item of clothing in Hoi An is a scam.  There were limited items to choose from for free.  Additionally, I felt a bit pressured to buy something from Ann Tailor.  There were so many tailor shops in Hoi An that it would have been preferential to be given time to look around, check our different stores and then choose a tailor which met our needs.  \n\n​The hotel selected for us in Ho Chi Minh City was very poor .  The hotel, Hoang Ngan Hotel, was outdated, cramped room, found hair all over the floor, smoke smells waft into our room and noisy.  When we provided this feedback to Hoi An Express, they responded defensively claiming we were given the name of the hotel prior to the trip and could look it up online.  This wasn't the point of us providing feedback - it was so that Hoi An Express could consider booking a different hotel in HCMC for future tours.  \n\n​Lastly, I thought we'd see more of Ho Chi Minh​ City itself - the excursions to Mekong and Cu Chi Tunnels were good, but for 3 nights in Ho Chi Minh, I expected more time in the city.  \n\n​I hope this review provides insight for future travellers.\n​Cheers"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"very nice tour, good itinerary: highlights ot the country (north / center / south) and angkor temples, good Price, good 3* hotels, most of them downtown, small groups, good guides"},{"rating":"3.0","review":"Communication needs improvement. Without a guide that travels with the group there is lack of continuity. To compensate for this the local guides need to receive and communicate the agenda as guests arrive. This was done in Siem Reap and this seemed better organized. The hotel in Ho Chi Minh City was substandard, even for a 3 star property.(Icon 36)  We had to pay extra to get a room with a window in it and it still smelled like mold. Hotels in Vietnam are very affordable. There was no need to put us in that dump."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Took the 3 star option. All hotels were good quality, clean and central with helpful staff. Ha long bay was an amazing way to start the tour. Tour of Hà Nội was limited to Ho Chi Minh morseleum and presidential palace grounds. Not able to get inside morselium as closed for annual maintainence, would have been good to have seen a bit more of the city, even if only from the mini bus.\nOur tour Guide for da nang and Hoi An was Hung. He was amazing, really informative and friendly. The foodie bike tour was great fun and enjoyed all the food. Only suggestion would be to spend a bit more time in the countryside on the bikes. \nAgain we had a great tour guide in Ho Chi Minh city, Lam. She was also really friendly, informative and fun. Massive difference from the Hà Nội city tour, felt like we’d seen more of the city and lam was very flexible to our requirements.\nMain reason for Siem Reep was the temples of Angkor wat. Tour guide not up to the same standard as Hung or Lam. When we arrived at the temples he said rather than going back for breakfast we would just stay and complete the tour. Probably worked out better as there were less crowds, but if we had known that we would not be going back to the hotel before the rest of the tour we would have brought bags with water, sun cream, hats, food etc.\nOverall the tour was really well organised, our guides were always there on time, or early. Would definetaly book a Hoi An Express tour again. Fantastic value for money.\nBooking experience with tour radar was also great. Loved the messaging system for updates and queries, very responsive and quick."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This is a great tour, busy itinery but plenty of free time to explore at your own pace, hotels were well located and clean, we had the most amazing view in Ho Chi Minh, fab way of seeing the best of two beautiful countries.

I enjoyed all the included tours and had at least half a day free at each city in which I could plan to do my own activities. I do suggest Travellers have a plan for these times but found that the local guides where able to direct us to good activities at each location.  We opted for the 3 star hotels and could not fault any of them on location or service.  They also provided an option to fly between HCMC and Siem Reap which gave us an extra half day at HCMC to take advantage of. We also booked the Water Puppet and Buffet Meal in Hanoi and were impressed by the quality of the buffet meal (a highlight of our trip) and the Bat Trang Pottery Village tour which we also enjoyed."},{"rating":"3.0","review":"I really would not recommend this tour company and theres a lot of detail i wish i'd known before i booked. I was solo traveller and that seemed to be a negative for these guys. They told me they wouldn't offer me any activities options because i was travelling alone and they don't do them for just 1 person. They then refused outright to provide any advice on how i could do the activities or visits at all. This is in stark contrast to other group tour companies. I'd just finished an Intrepid tour prior to this one and wish i'd continued with them. \n\nThe company are set up as a day tour company and for these longer trips they sort out the logistics of getting from place to place and the hotels. Otherwise its like being on a day/ half day tour for the things you do. There is no consistency and no one to ensure things run smoothly in-between. The tour guide is different day to day and not someone you can ask questions about the trip as a whole. They give you a local mobile at the start but its pay as you go, and after a couple of calls to their office it runs out and you have to pay to top it up to use it ( its an old nokia, not a smartphone).\n\nI booked the 4 star option. The hotels were generally 3 star level and were usually quite far out of city so you had to get taxi's everywhere. The hotel in Ho Chi Minh City was actually right next to the airport so 8 km out of city and they absolutely refused to acknowledge that this was a problem. I ended up moving to one in the city for 2 nights and paid for it myself. I didn't want the hotel to be the reason i didn't enjoy that city.\nThe hotel in Danang (Cecilia) was nice and next to the beach. Flower garden hotel in Hanoi was really unfriendly and unhelpful. I got terrible mosquito bites in their foyer waiting for my room. The Halong bay tour was great, but they're a different company that Hoi An Express buy from. My hotel in Hoi An was ok, a new hotel so slightly inexperienced staff but friendly, and again miles out from the city. They had a shuttle bus service but the times never really suited. The Siem Reap hotel ( Sokha Roth) was 3 star at best, not very clean and required a lot of prompting to get information to help me in the city. \n\nAlso, the \"free\" item of clothing in Hoi An is a scam. Its not like the pictures and you have to pay a lot extra for anything half decent. I went elsewhere and got something nice but the rest of the group were quite unhappy with what the got from Ann Tailor.\n\nProblem is i booked a group tour so that i would do the tour with other people around but the rest of the group were on a 3 star package and always in different hotels miles away so i essentially did the tour alone. \nThese guys have so much to learn about group tours for people from overseas.

There's quite a lot of city time - watch out for mad motor bikers on pavements - and some very obvious tourist stops, but the activities were very varied and there was also some free time. The markets and temples were amazing although I wasn't so sure about the floating village being treated as a tourist attraction as it appeared that none of the money generated was going to the people there.\n\nWe stuck with the three star hotel options and they were all perfectly adequate, all with comfy beds and in good locations. We particularly liked the hotel in Hoi An and the lovely City River Hotel in Siem Reap.\n\nFood was good. I like trying local dishes and my partner is strictly meat and potatoes, no spice, but we both found plenty to suit our very different tastes. \n\nOur guides were excellent. Dung in Hanoi was super, and Dong, Ming, Bau and Sophea all looked after us very well. Yes a couple had quite strong accents, as you would expect from a local company, but they all had great local and historical knowledge and I felt I learnt a lot about culture and life in those two countries.\n\nHoi An Express are a great company to deal with. From the very first day they answered emails quickly and always let us know about any minor changes to timings in the itinerary in good time. We pretty well stuck to this itinerary but other people we crossed paths with on our travels told us they were very flexible in adapting arrangements if you wanted. The Vietnamese phone they provided was a very thoughtful accessory.\n\nWith the amount of development going on, and pollution from diesel fumes and plastics, I would really recommend going to this part of the world sooner rather than later. I hope they develop more ecotourism before it's too late. Definitely go though, you'll receive a warm welcome, especially in Cambodia, and it's a fascinating part of the world."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"This is a good tour if you wish a fairly relaxed and cost effective approach.  Generally, we had about 1/2 every day of free time.  The highlight for us was Ha Long Bay:  beautiful, very nice boat.  The two nights we spent in DaNang were not too interesting, except for the visit to My Son.  Hotel in Hoi An was delightful(we were using the 3 star option).  The custom tailor coupon was actually very nice addition.  The hotel in Saigon was pretty ragged--would definitely upgrade on that one.  Otherwise everything was good.  The guides were always helpful, but not quite up to what you would find on a larger tour group--ours was only 5 people.  There was only one screw up on the trip when, in Da Nang, the driver took us to international vs domestic terminal which caused us some heartache due to time factor to check in.  "},{"rating":"4.5","review":"From the first moment we contacted them to the final farewell of our holiday, Hoi An delivered. This is quite a full on itinerary and you can expect some early starts and quite a lot of travelling. Hanoi as a starting point was a bit of a shock to the system due to the traffic and madness of the motor bike riders but you got used to it and other stops were much more pedestrian friendly.  We might have liked a bit more time in out of town locations but there's only so much you can do covering so much ground in 14 days. \nAlthough the welcome on the first day didn't happen, the hotel looked after us and passed on itinerary information; all other transfers and pick ups went like clockwork, we were well notified of any slight changes to timings and the staff - admin, hotels and tour guides - were all great. Yes there were a couple of guides with quite heavy accents and not quite perfect English but that's what you can expect when travelling with a local company. They all had good local knowledge, we felt we learnt a lot, and they went out of their way to make our holiday a success.  \nThe three star hotels were all perfectly adequate and in good locations. (If we were doing it again, we might consider 4 star in the bigger cities.) We particularly liked City River Hotel in Siem Reap where the welcome from the staff was exceptional. \nThere was variety and some slots for free time - if you had the energy!  You need to be prepared for some poignant reminders of the region's history and also some very stark contrasts between rich and poor. The region has a long way to go in terms of balancing the needs of the local people and the environment with a growing \"selfie mad\" tourist trade but if you're going as we did to see new sights and sounds, try new foods and experience a different culture, you won't be disappointed.\nWe would happily recommend Hoi An as a company. They are a good sized, well established company who clearly know what they are doing. The attention to detail was good, e.g., the provision of a local SIM card mobile phone to be able to contact them 24/7 whilst in Vietnam. \nWe took one of the special offers on this trip and would say at that price it was exceptionally good value for money.

I think that our tour guide Kien made the trip amazing. He was clear and concise, entertaining, and provided lots of useful information. I enjoyed his talks about Vietnam history, culture, and people. He was always so helpful. I felt like he was taking very good care of us throughout the entire trip. I can't say enough about Kien! As for the itinerary, there were two days of travel that I found tiring. One was the overnight train sleeper train ride to Hue. It's not easy for me to sleep on a train with three other people in the same berth. Still, I am glad I tried it as now I can say that I've done it. Plus, the people in my cabin were lovely and nice. There was one day when we had to wake up at 330 am to catch a plane to Ho Chi Minh City. The trip notes referred to this as \"an early morning flight to Ho Chi Minh City.\" I guess it didn't sink in just how tiring that day would be. After the flight, we took a three hour bus ride to the Mekong Delta. If you add up the time spent waiting in the airport and the time sitting on the plane, I think we must have sat for at least 8 hours that day. I am normally a very active person and one thing I found difficult about this tour was getting enough exercise. I felt like we sat a lot of the time, e.g. on a tour bus, at the restaurants, on boats, on a plane, on the train, etc. Having said all this, I don't know how I could have seen all the things that I was able to see in 10 days. I really felt like I saw Vietnam on this trip. And I also felt that the tour was well organized, all except for the first and last hotel. We weren't told which hotel we would stay at in Ho Chi Minh so I could not book my hotel for the next day (we stayed an extra day) with knowledge of where we would be moving from. I also did not know the first hotel until much closer to the tour date. By then, I had already booked a hotel in Hanoi in the centre of town. TOURRADAR will book additional nights stays before and after the tour in the tour hotel but I found the cost to be much higher than what I was able to find on BOOKING.COM. All in all, I give this tour a five star rating because I don't think much can be improved given the itinerary. One additional comment - it was an unexpected joy to get a pair of pants tailored in Hoi An. I wish I had scoured magazines for pictures of clothes that I like in advance to have them ready when I arrived. I chose to get pants tailored only at the last minute and was pleased with the results. So inexpensive and the pants fit perfectly!

Our tour guide Lang spoke excellent English, was so well organized, and made sure everyone’s needs were met. The common thread was the welcoming, friendly nature of the Vietnamese people.

Halong is breath-taking, honestly, very beautiful!\nFor Ho Chi Minh city, Mekong River cruise is simply wonderful and is highly recommended. Our guide Han was superb there. The icing on the cake was small boat ride in a small canal, probably a rivulet of Mekong River. Our flight to Phu Quoc was delayed by 30 minutes and I was reminded carefully by your team. I highly appreciate it.  There is no enough words to describe how beautiful Phu Quoc beach is.  I definitely   had relaxing time and good memories here.\nThank you Rosie for all!"}]},{"name":"Hanoi, Sapa & Halong Bay plus Bakhan Village Resort - 9 Days","reviews":[{"rating":"4.5","review":"The trip was excellent value for money, all transport was seamless and organised.

It has good location but in a very dark and not clean street. The room has no windows and no fresh air. \n\nIn Nha Trang we stayed at An Vista hotel. The resort and the hotel are organized for Russian tourists. The 4 star An Vista Hotel has good location but the service was very poor. The tourists are treated like thieves. At check in the receptionist took our passports as a guarantee. The only other option was cash deposit. Unfortunately we didn’t have enough cash. The hotel pretends to have a private beach but the truth is that they have 8 sun beds. The hotel guests can receive vouchers for 3 hours if available. At the reception we were advise to wake up early and at 6 am to be one of the first in line for vouchers. Another problem was the lack of beach towels- some day they had and some not. If one is lucky to have voucher and towel he has to walk for 15  minutes to the “private beach” . We stayed 4 days but only 2 times the room was cleaned and the towels were changed. The breakfast was not good too."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The overall tour was amazing and it was planned out perfectly. Got to see many like-minded people.

The airport transports were always on time no matter the time of day or night.\n\nI was unhappy with one guide in Hanoi, however.  He was not a Legend guide but called himself a freelancer.  He said his name was Hung or his work name is Kim.  He provided the city tour of Hanoi.  He didn't seem to be interested in performing his job and his English language was poor.  He told us very little about the sites we were visiting and usually departed from the group to smoke his cigarettes.  He only provided us with a small bowl of pho for lunch rather than going to a restaurant.  I think any non-Legend guides you use should be thoroughly researched prior to use in the future.

The first day of trekking was quite long and we had to ride a bike at the end. The weather has changed during a day like four seasons of a year (the guide said that). Our guide was helpful. He knew everything there to suggest us good restaurants and local market to buy souvenir. All hotels and cruise during the trips were situated in good locations. Staff was nice.

They gave us just the right amount of information when visiting places and really took the us and what we wanted to do into consideration. We had a overnight stay on a cruise in Ha long bay which was magical. It was the most incredible place to see and we were able to explore it and just enjoying being surrounded by such an amazing view. Having one night on the cruise was just perfect as with the company we stayed with the second night would have been a repeat of the first so Tourrader made a great choice of having us there for only the one night. Food and everything was really lovely and traditional which was great to try. Would absolutely recommend and would do another tour with Tourrader again as everything was so effortless and enjoyable.

Guide and driver are very much recommended!!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Excellent service from Tourradar, efficient, person centred and kept me well informed. We were picked up on time from Hanoi airport by our guide, Tang Kim Dung she took us to the hotel and made sure that everything was in order before she left. Next day she was there on time. Very knowledgable and efficient, she gave good explanation of everything. I must mention the driver, ver polite, he kept an immaculate car and always had fresh water for us, a lovely touch. We were picked up on time for our trip to Halong Bay, all went well but I am not sure what we received for our additional $25 per person for the galla evening, not even a glass of champers at midnight, some cheap stuff that wasn't drinkable. Please don't get me wrong the crew were great but I sensed that quite rightly they were always great. Guide then picked us up for our trip to Sapa, again she ensured we were safely on board and settled before she left. Sapa - well this was a bit of a disappointment. Our itinerary stated a trek, what we got was a 2 hour walk on a proper road, yes there were interesting things to see, but there were lots of people on the same road. We then stopped for lunch for a hour, we had anticipated further walking in the afternoon but our guide dropped us off at 12.50. The rest of the day was free but there is nothing to do in Sapa if your not out trekking, very disappointing. The guide was informative but also annoying as he was often on his mobile phone. Next morning the guide suggested leaving at 7 am, from our experience the day before I said 7.30. In reality we could have left at 9. Lovely 2 hour drive, we stopped at the market, which is like any other market in Asia , so no need to have 2 hrs there. We couldn't do the river trip as the river was too dry due to the dam restricting the flow of water. So we were back in our destination by 12 MD with 9 hours to fill in, in a City that has nothing for tourists. Here our guide was very helpful and got us a room in a hotel but it was a long wait, so we did two ten hour trips on a train for 2 hours walking, a three hour drive the next day. ( which was enjoyable) and 45 mins at a market. Please sort this out for others. I am sure that others have said this but Sapa is now very commercialised and you may want to suggest other things for the itenary. I hope you find this useful, it is intended to be. Best wishes Julie"}]}]
