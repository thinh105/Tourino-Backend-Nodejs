Our time will be spent weaving through a maze of 36 trading streets filled with colourful goods for sale, and unwinding in the walled gardens of the Temple of Literature. Later, we'll roam French-style boulevards and maybe dine on a nom ngo sen lotus-stem salad, dau chien ron fried tofu & a few bia hoi beers."

This former imperial capital is an eclectic mix of busy streets and peaceful beauty. The rest of the morning is free for you to relax, perhaps pick up a classic Hue breakfast of bun bo Hue, a popular Vietnamese soup containing rice vermicelli (bun) and beef (bo). After lunch you will visit the Imperial Citadel, a sprawling complex of temples, pavilions, moats, gates, and walls. The Ngo Mon Gate, Thai Hoa Palace and the Ancestral Altars are still impressive, and the complex must have been awe-inspiring during its heyday in the 19th century. In your free time you might like to visit to Dong Ba Market, which offers locally made goods, fresh produce and tantalising street food. This is a good place to try the specialties enjoyed by Emperor Nguyen such as the banh khoai royal rice cake. Accommodation: Hotel"

You’ll have your own driver who will take you first on a drive around the Imperial Citadel, including the Forbidden Purple City. The latter was almost completely destroyed during the Tet Offensive in the Vietnam War, but its humble, foliage-covered ruins remain a testament to its proud history. Here you'll gain some insight into the horrific damage endured during the war. Break up your sightseeing with a dragon boat cruise on the Perfume River. Then it's on to the Thien Mu Pagoda, the unofficial symbol of Hue. This site dates back to 1601 and is still an active Buddhist monastery. Here you’ll also see the car left by a monk who set himself alight to protest the treatment of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese regime. Ride to a special lunch spot at a convent or Buddhist monastery for a delicious vegetarian feast. After lunch, drive to the royal tomb of Emperor Tu Duc, set amid a lake, frangipani bushes and pine trees. This evening, perhaps ask your leader for the best place to try imperial street specialties.

Known as Faifo to early western traders, it was one of South-East Asia's major international ports from the 17th to the 19th centuries. Today, parts of Hoi An look exactly as they did more than a century ago and it retains the feel of times past, making it the sort of place that grows on you the more you explore it. On arrival, a walking tour will take you around the major sites of Hoi An’s charming Old Town, including an historic house (formerly home to a prominent trader), the Japanese Covered Bridge, a Chinese assembly hall and a museum.

Here we set out on a sailing boat for an exploration of the Bay and the many wonders within.   This exciting 4-hour cruise provides a fantastic view of the bay which is dotted with some 3,000 limestone islands rising amazingly from the clear and emerald water. These limestone karst formations are littered with beaches, grottoes and beautiful caves. Along the way we will anchor for a leisurely swim in a secluded cove and an enjoyable visit to one of the many hidden grottoes beneath the towering cliffs.   After your exploration of Ha Long Bay, we will transfer you to Ninh Binh, making sure you have the chance to take in the beautiful scenery along the way.

About 150 kilometres from the famous Vietnamese bay is another equally as impressive landscape. This one, known as Trang An, is nowhere near the coast though, and the mountains are connected by rice paddies, not water. After enjoying a delicious lunch, we will take a boat up the beautiful river fed by natural springs, through caves that bisect amazing limestone karst mountains to visit an Ancient 10th Century pagoda and temple.  After our visit to the Pagoda and Temple, it’ll be great fun to hop on a bike for a trip to Thung Nham Bird Garden. The route to the garden is a quiet one, consisting of flat roads and dams set to a back of stunning scenery. In total the round-trip is roughly 10 kilometres long.  After all this activity you might feel a bit damp, so we’ll take you back to the hotel where you can enjoy a shower and get cleaned up, before boarding the overnight train to Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park.  Following this, we will have dinner and a shower in central Ninh Binh town before boarding the overnight train to Phong Nha­Ke Bang National Park."

Our first stop is Eight Lady Cave which is named for the eight women working on the Route 20 highway who died from a bomb attack that caused a massive rock to seal off the exit, trapping them inside. Then we move on to Paradise Cave, one of the most beautiful and famous caves in Phong Nha stretching for more than 30 kilometres and featuring hundreds of incredible rock formations.  After lunch we visit the awesome Dark Cave by zip line or kayaks for the slightly less adventurous. With only a head torch to light our way, we will navigate through the darkness to the mud baths where you can either relax and soak up goodness, leaving you with baby smooth skin, or have some fun with a classic mud fight! Afterwards you can take a refreshing dip in the lake and wash all the mud away."

Over 600 people lived here and 17 babies were even born in these tunnels between 1965 and 1972.   After lunch we will visit the Mine Action Visitors Centre in Dong Ha, which examines the effects of the war that persist to this day, even after hostilities ended over 40 years ago in 1975. After this you will arrive in Hue, and discover Thien Mu pagoda which rests on the banks of the perfume river. This is actually the tallest pagoda in Vietnam, featuring 7 tiers reaching for the sky, each level representing one step of the path to enlightenment.  You will then spend the rest of the evening and night in Hue. "

The structure and its majestic architecture, built by Gia Long, sadly suffered extensive damage during the years of fierce conflict which took place here. These scars provide an extra layer of history, telling a tale of the decades of fighting long past.  We will continue your trip into the past by visiting Minh Mang Tomb, the final resting place of the 2nd emperor of Vietnam. This tomb is special in the way its architecture blends seamlessly with its surrounding landscape (a result of Minh Mang’s staunch belief in Confucianism). Following this, you can hop back on the bus and we’ll take you to the local beach to enjoy some lunch and cocktails as we swim and enjoy the sunset. This hidden gem is a great way to cap off an eventful day."

Special thing that tour guide would like to introduce some popular authentic food in lovely mini restaurants (not luxury restaurants) where you feel comfortable to sit down and enjoy some favorite dishes and nice drinks too. It's interesting to hear from tour guide about the history of the old quarter in Hanoi, it is thousand years old and today retains much of the old flavor that made the area special in earlier times, each street was the exclusive domain of one trade (guilds) so there are whole streets of blacksmiths, silver shops, paper shops, headstone makers and more. Originally there were just 36 old streets in the old quarter but today there are more than 50 streets. It is very difficult to find some local food stalls and mini restaurants on your own in hidden alleys and sidewalks, certainly the best way to make it easy is joining with Vietnam Travel Top, taking part in this special tour to learn about Vietnamese cuisine, culture, people and language. After all. Food on Foot Tour will give you an unique experience to try the foods of the local Hanoi people, we ensure the food is handled hygienically and provide a comfortable venue for the tastings.

The guide meets you in the hotel lobby and off we go. After a short car transfer to the South of Hanoi through a busy urban area, we veer off the main road and enter a very special district. It suddenly feels like stepping back in time, into the 1960’s when Hanoi was a quaint capital populated mostly by modest workers. Wander around these narrow alleys covered in colourful market stalls, feel the incredible vibe and let the guide tell you the story of these unusual big yellow buildings. We have a coffee break before transferring to the Temple of Literature. We visit the little gem of architecture and huge piece of history. For lunch, we suggest to walk to a nearby street food shop. There are several options, our favourite would be the Bun Cha flame-grilled pork meat served with sticky rice noodles.  In the afternoon, we continue to the garden of the Presidential Palace, where you can also see the One-Pillar Pagoda and the house on stilts where Ho Chi Minh lived. Afterwards, we have a quick fresh beer in a local bia hoi, the Vietnamese version of a pub. We return to the hotel in the afternoon. The rest of the day is at your own leisure.  Overnight in Hanoi.

After breakfast in home-stay, we say goodbye to villagers and leave Mai Chau around 10 am. We ride from Mai Chau to the direction of Moc Chau, where we have lunch. This highland town produces some of Vietnam’s best tea and is a good place to stock up.  The surrounding area is also home to several ethnic minorities, including Green H’mong, Dzao, Thai and Muong. Moc Chau boasts a pioneering dairy industry that started in the late 1970s with Australian (and, later, UN) assistance. The dairy provides Hanoi with such delectable iuxur us as fresh milk, sweetened condensed milk and little tooth-rotting bars called “Banh sua”.

There is also the option for a very challenging back route which takes us through several river crossings. The massive mountain range dominates the road until finally we must make a splendid climb up from Binh Lu and up to the top of the highest road pass in Vietnam (Tram Ton Pass).  Y Ty, one of the poorest communes in Lao Cai Province’s Bat Xat District, has become an attractive tourism destination in recent years due to its natural beauty. Y Ty is still a strange name to many Vietnamese people. Nestled against 2,700m Nhi Cu San mountain, the commune rarely sees the sun and is often covered by dense white clouds. This lovely land is a must-see destination for photographers and nature lovers who dont want to be in the crowd of Sapa. Terraced fields beautifully make up the place in which tourists themselves can witness the transplanting of seedlings called “pouring water season” every May and seeing the whole area turn to green after. The sight is so astonishing that it has become a favorite shooting destination for both amateur and professional photographers.  Y Ty has become famous for its unique terraced fields made by the ethnic minority group Ha Nhi. The fields have varying terrain, but the Ha Nhi people manage to make wide and beautiful fields that amazingly fit the valley curves and high mountain slopes.  Another special feature of Y Ty is its earthen houses whose architectural design is simple yet one-of-a-kind. It is mushroom-shaped especially when viewed from atop. There is only one door and a small arched window but enough to keep warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Though the design is basic, it takes one month to build an earthen house.

You’ll ride through parks, around lakes, and down tree-lined boulevards and visit iconic sights such as the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum complex, which includes the Buddhist temple One Pillar Pagoda and the former residence of Vietnam’s most famous revolutionary, Ho Chi Minh. \nThere’s also time to explore the vibrant Old Quarter, an architectural museum where blocks of ochre buildings give off the air of a 1930s provincial French town. In these ancient ’36 Streets’ discover an amazing selection of shops that sell everything from souvenirs to exquisite silk clothing, jewellery, beautifully embroidered tablecloths, wood carvings and lacquerware - it's a bargain hunter's paradise. \nYou’ll have some free time this afternoon. Perhaps take a walk around the beautiful Hoan Kiem Lake, with the reflection of modern office buildings, old Buddhist temples and the tangle of ancient streets in its still surface, or maybe dive into culture at the Vietnam Fine Art Museum or The Vietnamese Women’s Museum.

Sleeper trains typically have four berth compartments (occasionally six berth depending on seasonal variations and group configuration), which have bench seats that convert into sleeping bunks. A sheet, pillow and blanket are provided, although some travellers prefer to bring their own sleeping sheet. On occasion, passengers of different genders will be required to share a compartment and there will be occasions where you'll be sharing with local travellers or travellers who are not part of your group.

The itinerary is flexible and you have ample time for stops along the way to admire the sites. Later, kick back in a cafe or restaurant. Hue’s cuisine is considered by many Vietnamese as the best in the country, and is influenced both by its imperial heritage (small dishes and a focus on aesthetic presentation) as well as its strong Buddhist heritage, reflected in the high proportion of vegetarian restaurants in the region. The bustling Dong Ba Market offers a wealth of goods and foods to see and snack on. It's a good place to try some of the local specialities that graced the Nguyen emperors' banquet tables, such as the ‘banh khoai’, Hue's answer to the pancake.\nRiding distance: approx. 16kms/10 miles, flat with approx. 12m/40ft of elevation gain.
